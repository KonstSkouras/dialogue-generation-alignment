B|11| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: [And] [, you know [,] just] [, you] _see_ [a] lot [of] things [like] [you] [, you know ,] was [a] great golfer [and] wanted [to] play golf [when] _he retired_ _, and_ [you know] [that] [a] lot [of] [the] things _he_ thought _he _would_ do_ [when] _he retired_ he's _not_ able [to] _do_ now .

A|20| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: [and] [my] mom [has to] take _care of_ [her] pretty [much] [so] [it] [gets] _, I don't know _._ It's_ _, _it's_ a_ hard decision , [but] [I don't think] _I [would_ do] [it] [to] [my parents] personally 
A|22| A: _I know_ at this [, _I] know_ [I] feel [like] [I [would] never] [do] [that] [with] [my parents] either [, you [know] [.] But] _I , I_ [really] feel [bad] [for] [the] [people] [I] [see] _not_ very _, _I'm_ not really_ [, really] experienced [but] [like] [I] [said] [I] [just] [have] [that] one family _, and_ [I] [just] [really] feel [bad] [for] [the] guy who his whole life [is] different now [and ,] than [he] thought [it] [would] be [.

B|23| B: When [he retired] ? 
A|24| A: _Yeah _,_ and_ he's got [, you know ,] seven brothers [and] sisters [and _,] [and_ , uh ,] he's [the] one [because] he's [the] one [that] isn't going [to] work every day [and] [that] [she] moved [in] [with] [when] [she] needed [to] move [in] [with] someone . [And] , 
B|25| B: [Yeah _,] it's_ [like] [that] _good_ [for] _us_ [just] [because] [my] [uncle] [and] [my [,] and] [my] mom switch off [like] _we_ [have] [her] [for] [three] months [and] then [he has] [her] [for] [three] months . 
A|26| A: [Oh [,] well ,] that's great . 
B|27| B: [So] [that] [, that] works out _good_ . 
A|28| A: That's [a] [good] idea . We ought [to ,] [Yeah [,] and] maybe [when] [the] _other_ brothers [and] sisters retire [or] whatever [, I don't know] what they're going [to] [do] [. It's] [really] _not_ [my] family [. It's] [my] fiancee's [so] [I don't , I] can't say [much] . 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [But] [I] always feel [like] [I [would] never put] [my parents] [in] either [and] [I] wonder _, I'm_ going [to] be [the] only sibling [that] isn't going [to have] children [so] [if] [my parents] [do] need [to] live [with] someone _, it_ will probably be [with] me [because] all [my] brothers [and] sisters will be having teenagers around [and] everything [to] [care] [for] . _You_ [know ,] 
B|31| B: Really ? 
A|32| A: [and] _I'm_ [, _I] ,_ that's fine [with] me . [my] fiancee [and] [I] both figure that's what's , we're going [to] end up [with] both [of] [the] [parents] [or] whoever . If _You_ [know] what [I mean] ? We feel [like] [, it's] [our] responsibility , 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [and] [I] feel [like] [I [would] never put] [them] [in a] [home [.] But] [I] wonder [how] [much] [, you know ,] [if] one [of] [us] [is] going [to have] [to] quit work someday [or] retire early [or] something . 
B|35| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: _You think_ [about] [it] [and] [it's] [really] [, I don't know .] This country [kind of] takes [the] worst [care of] [the] [elderly] [of] any _other_ country . 
B|37| B: [You think] ? [I , I] [I'm not really] familiar [with] [how] _other countries_ , 
A|38| A: [And] , [It's] [really] [more] [of] [a] [, um , [like] a] respect issue [that] [the older] , [older people] [in] [other countries] [that] [I've been] [to] seem [to] [really] [have] [a] lot [more] respect [for] [the] [elderly] [people] [and [,] and] they [really] seem _as_ wise [and [,] and] [in] this country nobody [really] , [Yeah ,] nobody [really] pays attention 
B|39| B: [They're] seen [as] senile 
A|40| A: [and] they [, oh [,] the] old-timer made [with] [the] old [way] [and] nobody respects [the] traditions . [And] [, you know [,] it's] [I _,] [I'm_ not] saying [that] [I] [do] either [but] [you know [,] it's] [just] funny 
B|41| B: Right . 
A|42| A: [and [,] and] [we] [really] [don't] [have] any [that] [don't] [have] [the] Social Security [and] everything [really] isn't [that] [much] [for] [elderly] [people] [to] live [on] . 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [You] [know ,] even [if] they're [in] [good] health [it's] incredible . 
B|45| B: Right . 
A|46| A: They [don't] [have] any , they [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe they [should] [, you know] [because] we're all going [to] get old someday . 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh [.] [I] [know] .] 
A|48| A: [And] [so] [it's a] [, [it's] kind of] [a] depressing topic though . How old are [you] ? 
B|49| B: [Um [,] I'm] twenty . 
A|50| A: [So] [it is] , yeah [, and] [it] must be rough [for] [you] too [to] [see] your grandmother .
