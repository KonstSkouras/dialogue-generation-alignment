B|0| B: _Okay_ _what_ kind _of_ foods would _you have_ ? 
A|1| A: _Okay ._ _Um_ _, well _, I_ like_ _to_ _cook_ _, um_ 
B|2| B: _Oh [,_ I] _do_ _too_ 
A|3| A: _but I_ don't _like_ getting [too] awfully fancy _about_ _it _,_ just because_ _, um _,_ uh _,_ it's_ [too] _much_ pressure . You _know ,_ 
B|4| B: _Uh-huh _. Uh-huh_ ._ 
A|5| A: _if I_ [have] _people over_ _for_ _dinner_ _, _I like_ it_ _to_ _be_ nice _and_ relaxed . 
B|6| B: _Yeah , you_ _can't_ enjoy _it ._ Right . 
A|7| A: [Yeah] . _And_ so [I] don't _like_ _to_ arrive , _or_ , _or_ _when_ _they_ arrive , _for me_ _to_ _be_ completely worn _out_ . 
B|8| B: That's _, that's_ _what_ [, I like] doing things [like] making lasagna [just because] [I] _can_ [have] [it] ready [and] baking _in the oven ,_ 
A|9| A: [Yeah] . 
B|10| B: _it's ,_ 
A|11| A: Exactly . 
B|12| B: everybody [just] says how wonderful [it] _is_ _, and it's_ [it's] [like] [, uh ,] yes , 
A|13| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|14| B: [I] . 
A|15| A: [Yeah] . 
B|16| B: That's _one of_ those things [I] got famous [for] _in_ college . People would come [and] say could would _you_ come _over and_ _make_ lasagna [for me] 
A|17| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|18| B: _It's_ [like] [, well , _I] can't_ _really_ give _you_ _a_ _recipe_ [, uh] 
A|19| A: [Uh-huh] , you'd _just do [it_ .] 
B|20| B: [I] _can_ [I] _can_ [just do it] 
A|21| A:  . 
B|22| B: [I like] doing _that_ kind _of_ _stuff_ . 
A|23| A: [Yeah] . 
B|24| B: [And] _it's , it's_ _fun_ , _in_ fact _that's_ _what_ we had [for] _a_ Christmas party last week . 
A|25| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|26| B: We [just] had _a_ bunch _of_ [people _over] and_ we had , we did lasagna [and] garlic bread _and [,_ uh ,] yummy . 
A|27| A: _Um ._ Boy [I like] [that] . 
B|28| B: Uh [, I] [do] _too ,_ _in_ fact 
A|29| A: [Yeah [,] well] _I'm_ _planning_ _a [,_ and] naturally _this is_ appropriate _because I'm_ _planning_ _dinner_ [for] [people] tomorrow night _and then_ [the] next night . 
B|30| B: _Oh_ . _Oh ,_ _good ._ 
A|31| A: _So_ Tuesday night there'll _be_ eight [people] here altogether . 
B|32| B: Uh , actually _one_ thing we [have] _done_ quite [a] _bit_ through [the] holidays [, just because] [it's] [a ,] real _easy_ , [is] [just] baked potato dinners . 
A|33| A: _Oh _, yeah_ ,_ uh-huh . 
B|34| B: [And] [have] _, you [know_ ,] [like] _three_ [or] four couples come [over] [, and] _I'll_ [do] [the] potatoes _and _you_ [know_ ,] [like] butter [and] cheese [and] _stuff_ [and] [have] everybody else [just] _bring_ [a] couple _of_ toppings , whatever [they] [like] 
A|35| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|36| B: _and it_ turns [out] great , [because] [I] mean , you've got [like] hot sauce [and] taco meat [and] barbecue _and _,_ you [know_ ,] bacon [and] all [that] _good_ _stuff_ . 
A|37| A: [Yeah [,] that's] [fun] [. Uh-huh .] 
B|38| B: _But_ _it's , it's_ inexpensive 
A|39| A: [Yeah] . 
B|40| B: plus [it's] real _easy_ _on_ [the] hostess , [because] _you can_ [just] [have] [the] potatoes ready [, and] [just] _have a_ salad _with [it_ _,] and you_ got [a] great [dinner] . 
A|41| A: [Yeah [,] that's] [a] [good] idea . 
B|42| B: _It's_ [, it's] real _easy_ [, I like] doing [that] part . 
A|43| A: [Yeah] . 
B|44| B: [I'm] _in_ favor _of_ _very_ _little_ clean _up [,_ um ,] _very_ _little_ [planning] [because] we've got _three_ [or] four couples [that] we _get_ together _with_ [to] play games , 
A|45| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh] _, yeah ._ 
B|46| B: _and _it's_ ,_ 
A|47| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|48| B: we invariably end _up_ at _my_ house since _I've_ got _two_ kids . 
A|49| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|50| B: [And] _that _,_ it's , it's_ fine , [because] [then] [I] _can_ [just] say , [Okay] fine _, you_ _bring_ [this] _, you_ _bring_ [this] _, you_ _bring_ [this] , we're _done_ . 
A|51| A: [Yeah] . 
B|52| B: [And] [it's] pretty cool . 
A|53| A: [Yeah [,] that's] [good .] Well , [one of] [my] favorites _if I_ don't _want to_ [have] other [people] [bring] [stuff] [, I] [just] _want to_ treat them [is] [to] [make] _chicken_ [and] _rice ._ 
B|54| B: [Uh-huh .] [Oh] . 
A|55| A: [It's] [very] [easy] [to] . 
B|56| B: [Oh] . 
A|57| A: You don't _like _it_ ?_ 
B|58| B: [Oh [,] I] love [it] 
A|59| A: [Oh [,] you] _do _,_ okay_ _, yeah _._ I_ [have a] [really] [easy] [recipe] [for] [that _,] where _you_ just brown the chicken_ _and then_ _you put_ _rice_ [in the] bottom _of the_ _pan_ [, you] pour _bouillon_ [or] _chicken_ broth [over] [it] 
B|60| B: [Um .] 
A|61| A: [and [,] and _you] put_ _the chicken_ _in ,_ [then] pour _the [,_ uh ,] broth [over [and] [you] can] _put_ mushrooms [in] _if you want_ [, _and] then_ _you just_ . 
B|62| B: Over [the] _uncooked rice_ ? 
A|63| A: [Yeah ,] [over] [uncooked rice] 
B|64| B: [Oh] . 
A|65| A: [and [you] can] either _microwave_ [it] _or [do_ it] [in the oven _,] and it_ [just] . 
B|66| B: [Oh ,] how neat . 
A|67| A: It fluffs [up [,] and it's] [really] moist . 
B|68| B: Huh . Now _I've done it_ _with_ [, where [you] put] [, you] [cook] [the] [well , I] guess [you] probably could [do it] same way , [but] [cook] _the rice_ [and then] take [a] [can] [of] [like] cream [of] mushroom soup [or] cream [of] [chicken] soup [, and] [put] _a little bit_ [of] white wine [in] [it .] 
A|69| A: [Uh-huh] , wow _, yeah ._ 
B|70| B: [And] every once [in] [a] while _, I'll_ _put in _,_ I'll_ slice white grapes [and] _I'll_ _put in_ _there_ [, [and] [,] that's] [just [because] I'm] _not_ [a] real big wine person [but [I] like [it] ,] [it] adds something [to] [the chicken] . 
A|71| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] . 
B|72| B: [And] [then] [just] bake [it [,] and it] makes [a] wonderful sauce [over] _the [rice_ .] 
A|73| A: Well [, I'll] keep [that] [one] [in] mind . 
B|74| B: [Yeah] 
A|75| A: [Yeah] . 
B|76| B: [It's] , [that] _was_ [one [of] the] first things [I] made [for] [my] husband , [because] [I] _was_ [like] [, um [,] yeah] 
A|77| A: [Yeah] . 
B|78| B: [I] could actually find something [I] could [cook] real [easy] [that] would [be] kind [of] sort [of] elegant kind [of] 
A|79| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah , [you] _can] get_ away [with it] even having [a] semi nice [dinner] , 
B|80| B: [Oh [, yeah] .] 
A|81| A: [or] [, you know] semi . 
B|82| B: _But_ [then] [, I] hadn't thought [about] doing [it] [with] [uncooked [rice] .] 
A|83| A: [Yeah] . 
B|84| B: [So] [, _just] ,_ [like] [in] [a] thirteen by nine [pan] . 
A|85| A: [Yeah] . You [put in [,] um] 
B|86| B: [Um .] 
A|87| A: let's see , [what] [was] [it ,] [three] quarters [of] cup [of] [rice] [or] , 
B|88| B: [Um .] 
A|89| A: It depends [on] [, [you] can] [really] vary [it .] 
B|90| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|91| A: [But] _you have to_ [put] [the] water [in] proportionally _. [I_ can't] remember _. I_ think [it] [was] [three] quarters cup [rice] [to] [two] cups water , [two] cups [, um ,] broth . 
B|92| B: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] I] [, I] use [that] [for] [for] [rice] [and] [for] [when] [I] [cook] pasta [or] something [, I'll] [put] _a little bit_ [of] [bouillon] [in] _there_ [just] [to] give [it] _a little_ extra _flavor ._ 
A|93| A: [Yeah ,] [flavor [.] Uh-huh .] [Yeah] . 
B|94| B: [Um .] Now [that] would [be] [good .] 
A|95| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|96| B: How long [do] [you have to] bake [it ?] 
A|97| A: [Um] , let's see _. I_ think [it] [was] _an_ hour . [I've done it] _in the microwave_ so often lately [because] [, it's , it's] [really] [easy] . 
B|98| B: [I] [do [,] I] [do] [microwave] _too ,_ [a] lot 
A|99| A: [Yeah] . [But] [, I] think [it's] [about] _an_ hour . 
B|100| B: How long would [it] [be] how long would [it] [be] [in the microwave] ? 
A|101| A: Or maybe [it's] only half hour . [Um] [, _you] [just_ ,] until [the rice] looks fluffy [, and] [and] [not] overdone . You [know ,] before [it] gets overdone . 
B|102| B: [Oh [,] okay] . [Okay .] Do [you just brown the chicken] [to] [get] [it] colored 
A|103| A: [Yeah] . 
B|104| B: [or do] [you] go ahead [and] _let it cook_ through ? 
A|105| A: [Um] , I'd [let it cook] [just] [a little bit] [just] so [that] [the] cooking _goes_ [a little] faster . 
B|106| B: [Um .] Ooh , [this is] [a] beneficial call [. [I] like] [this] 
A|107| A: [Yeah [,] I] liked your idea [too ,] [there] . 
B|108| B: [Yeah ,] [but] [that] one's [an] [easy] [one] . [It's] [like] [, just] [put in ,] [a] friend [of] mine makes [it] [where] she [goes] ahead [and] seasons [up] [the ,] [with] [the] soup [and] [the] wine 
A|109| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|110| B: [put in] garlic [and] onion powder [or] chopped onions [if you [want] to] [do] [that [,] you know] . What ever , however [much] effort [you] feel [like] putting into [it .] 
A|111| A: [Yeah] [. Uh-huh .] 
B|112| B: [But] [it ,] [it] makes [a] great [, I] mean , [I've] got [a] [two] year old [and] [a] four year old [and] [they] love [it .] 
A|113| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|114| B: [And] , [because] [my] daughter calls [it] her gravy [and] [I] mean , she thinks [it's] wonderful , [my] , [good] , you're [a] picky eater , [if I] [can get] [you] [to] ,
