A|4| A: [Well _,] yeah_ [, I] _do_ _a_ lot _of_ [exercise] _. Right_ _now_ , _I'm_ into _jazzercise_ , which [I] absolutely love [. Uh , I] started [about] two years ago because [I] gained some weight over [the past] few years _and I_ wanted [to get] [it] _back_ [off] 
B|5| B: _Uh-huh_ . 
A|6| A: _and _I_ was_ going through _a_ divorce _and I_ _just_ found _that_ running _really_ made me _feel_ _good ._ 
B|7| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|8| A: Got [out] _a_ lot _of_ aggression [. I] went _to the_ gym [every] day _and I_ ran _on the treadmill_ [and] rode _the bike _and_ , uh , I_ felt _really_ _good [._ I] needed _to do it_ [and] _it was_ _really_ helpful at _the time_ _. Now_ _when I_ _do_ those [things] , they're boring [. [I] would] rather [be] outside [then] [in the] gym _doing_ this [in] _one_ place . 
B|9| B: _Uh-huh_ . 
A|10| A: And _so_ [I] _just_ recently discovered _jazzercise_ , [about] two months ago . And _I'm_ _getting_ [to be] _a good_ dancer from [it] [and] _I'm_ _just_ feeling _really_ _good [._ I] love [the] class _, it's_ real challenging , _so_ _I'm_ _really_ into _that [,_ I] _really_ [like] _that_ _a_ lot . 
B|11| B: [Well] [now] [that ,] _is_ [that [,] uh ,] _that's_ related [to the] , [the] _aerobic_ [, uh ,] , 
A|12| A: It _is _,_ it's_ aerobics _but_ _it's_ [with] dance steps . 
B|13| B: Okay . 
A|14| A: It's an [aerobic] [exercise] [and] _it's_ an hour straight . And _it's_ _just_ [, uh _,] it's_ _a_ lot _of_ fun . 
B|15| B: _Yeah , yeah_ . 
A|16| A: [and] _I'm_ , _I'm_ _getting_ [much] _better_ . My stamina [is] _getting_ great _for_ [the] dance floor _so_ _I mean_ _it's_ _just_ , 
B|17| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|18| A: there's _a_ lot _of_ positive [things] [with] _it ,_ _so_ . 
B|19| B: [Well [,] uh ,] okay [. Now] _that's_ _inside_ again , right ? 
A|20| A: It [is] [inside] _and I've_ been _doing_ _a_ lot _of_ _bike_ riding outside _with the_ nice weather we've been _having_ 
B|21| B: _But_ , 
A|22| A: _and I_ _just_ enjoy [that] [much] more too than [inside] . 
B|23| B: Do , [do] _you_ [like] [to do it] [with] other people [. [I] mean] [like] [the] , [the] [jazzercise] [would] [be] ? 
A|24| A: [I have] _a_ thirteen year old daughter _and so_ we _go_ _bike_ riding [and] _it's_ nice . We [get] [to] spend some _time_ together rather than _I go_ [to the] gym _while_ she does her homework . 
B|25| B: _Yeah _._ Yeah ._ 
A|26| A: So _I've_ _enjoyed_ [that] part _of_ [it] [. Yeah .] And at [the] gym , even [in the] class _, uh _, I_ _,_ it's_ _not_ _really_ _a_ group where [you] chat _a_ lot . Everybody's _on_ their way [to] someplace 
B|27| B: _Right ._ 
A|28| A: _and so_ _, you know [,_ I] [do] [have] _one_ friend who goes occasionally 
B|29| B: _But_ , 
A|30| A: _but_ , basically [, I] [do _it] by myself_ [in] _a_ group _of_ maybe forty _so_ . 
B|31| B: _Yeah ,_ right [. _Right] ._ _But_ still _there _are_ , there are_ other people _there_ [doing] [the] , [doing] [the] same thing . 
A|32| A: There [are , there are] . It's more motivating [that] way _, I think_ [. Yeah .] 
B|33| B: In terms [of] motivation [and] incentive [, yeah] . 
A|34| A: You could [get] _a_ tape probably [and] [do it] at home [in] front [of] [the] T V _but_ [you] probably wouldn't . 
B|35| B: [Yeah .] 
A|36| A: So . 
B|37| B: _Yeah [,_ uh ,] [that] makes [a] difference doesn't [it] ? 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] 
B|39| B: [I _,] I've_ , [one] thing , [when] , [when [I] have] run [and] jogged [, uh _,] I've_ _always_ [enjoyed] [doing] [it by _myself] [and_ _,] [and_ ,] [not] [with the] sense [that] [it was] [, uh [,] uh ,] chore or something [that] [I was] [having] [to do] [, I _,] I've_ [really] [enjoyed] [just] [the] activity [and , uh , I] write software [, uh ,] as far as [the] job [and so] [getting] [out] [and] being active [, uh ,] [is [,] uh [,] uh ,] helps [out] . The [, it's] 
A|40| A: [Yeah , yeah] [, _I] can_ see it'll [be] _a good_ break . 
B|41| B: The [the] [the] change [of] pace [and] [just] [getting] [out] [and] _around_ 
A|42| A: [Right .] 
B|43| B: [and _I] find that_ [I can] often [, you know ,] often [, uh ,] [when I] [get] _around_ [to] [doing] [it ,] [then] [I [,] I] _feel better_ [when I] [get] [back] [to] work 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|45| B: [and , uh [,] uh ,] also [that ,] [that ,] [it ,] my subconscious [is] working [on] [things] [while] [I'm] working [and [I] [,] [I] go] [back] [and I've] got new ideas , [but] still . 
A|46| A: _I think_ [you] [do] . You [feel] very _good_ after [you] [exercise] [. _I] think_ [it's] worth making _the time for yourself ._ 
B|47| B: [Yeah .] 
A|48| A: You owe [it] [to] _yourself_ 
B|49| B: [Yeah .] 
A|50| A: [and _I] think_ [you] [do] accomplish more after [that] . 
B|51| B: [Yeah .] 
A|52| A: And _I think_ [that] [it's] [just] [is] _good_ _for_ your self-esteem , _for_ everything because [when] [you] look [better] [, you] [feel better] [and] [it's] [just] _, uh , I think_ [it's] _well_ worth [it] [. I] [just] demand [that] _time for_ [myself] [. Now] [I've] learned [to do] [that] 
B|53| B: [Yeah .] 
A|54| A: [and [,] you know [,] and] [it's] _, I think_ [it] [just] benefits [you] all [around] . So . 
B|55| B: [Yeah [,] I think] _that's_ [, uh , I think] _that's_ [a good] term , demanding [the time for yourself .] That you've [just] got [to] you've [just] got [to] 
A|56| A: You [have] [to] . Because there's [always] more [things] [to do] . 
B|57| B: [Right .] 
A|58| A: There [is] [always] [things] [that] [you] [can] make priority [to] [it] [but] [I] [just] [, [I] don't] demand [a] lot [for] [myself [and] so] [you know [,] I] [just] [feel] entitled [to] [it] 
B|59| B: [Yeah .] 
A|60| A: [and I] take [it] [so] . 
B|61| B: [Well] [good] , [well] [good .] [Well [,] uh [,] uh ,] [have] [you] , [have] [you] _done_ any jogging ? [I] tell [you] [, you] said [you] did [on [the] bike and] [on the treadmill] [in] , [in the] [, uh ,] club . 
A|62| A: No [, I've] [done] some walking [with] friends [in the past] . 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh] . 
A|64| A: [But] [I find that] [when] [you] [do] [that [,] you] [do] more chatting than [you] [do] [exercise] 
B|65| B: [Yeah .] 
A|66| A: [and] [that's] [not] [really] beneficial , [so] [, uh] [I don't] [have] [time] [like] [that] 
B|67| B: [Yeah , yeah] . 
A|68| A: [and I] spend enough [time] chatting [around] everywhere [, you know]
