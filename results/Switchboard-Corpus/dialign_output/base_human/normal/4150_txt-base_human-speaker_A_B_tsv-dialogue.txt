B|23| B: _Well ,_ _I_ don't want [to] , _I_ don't want this [to] be [a] unilateral conversation _but ,_ yes [, we] [do] . Both _my_ husband [and] _I_ work [and] _our_ children are sixth , fourth [, and] third grade _. And the_ school [years] are wonderful , _they're_ [just] wonderful . 
A|24| A: Uh-huh . 
B|25| B: The [kids ,] they are real people [and] they are interesting [and] , they , they [have] all their _own_ [activities] [and] , um , _I_ think as parents _we really_ enjoy them [in] , _in our_ personal situation _our_ children [have] _not_ [yet] decided [to] rebel 
A|26| A: Uh-huh _. So_ [they're] pretty good [kids ,] huh ? 
B|27| B: I'm sure _that's_ coming though _. But ,_ they are wonderful [kids] . 
A|28| A: Yeah . [Well [,] _we] had_ growing up [I] guess [I] _can_ [talk about] [us [.] We] _had_ [nine] [kids] [in _our] _family_ [._ We] _had eight boys and one _girl_ [._ But ,] [my] Dad _, uh ,_ 
B|29| B: You [had eight boys and one girl] ? 
A|30| A: Yeah [. And _the] time_ [that] [my] [, we] spent [with] [our] Dad [was] , he owned his [own] business [so] [we] _worked_ [with] him most _of _the_ _time_ _._ So_ [that's] how [we] spent most _of _the_ [time_ with] him . 
B|31| B: Are [you] Mormons ? 
A|32| A: Yeah . 
B|33| B: That's what [the] Utah [and] [the] large [family .] 
A|34| A: [That was] [a] dead giveaway , huh ? 
B|35| B: [Well ,] _we're_ Catholics . [I] came from [a] [family] [of] five . [I] [had] four brothers , 
A|36| A: Uh-huh . 
B|37| B: [the] only [girl .] 
A|38| A: [Oh .] 
B|39| B: [And] everyone always asked if [the] [girl] got _spoiled_ . 
A|40| A: Which _that ,_ 
B|41| B: [I] never felt _spoiled_ . In fact [I] always thought [my] toys were destroyed 
A|42| A: _I was_ [going to] say , [my] sister wasn't [spoiled] _very_ much . 
B|43| B: [No .] Usually busy fighting [for] survival . 
A|44| A: Yeah , [that's] [. But ,] 
B|45| B: [Well ,] [I] [do] think [with] working parents _it_ is , [I] mean , _there_ are some real issues _here ._ _Um ,_ [that] [I] think , um , 
A|46| A: Uh-huh . 
B|47| B: [I] don't _know_ _. It's_ an interesting _problem_ . [I] happen [to] , um , I'm [a] pediatrician . 
A|48| A: [Oh .] 
B|49| B: My husband is [a] physician , [so] [, uh ,] [I] , [I] [I] [talk] [to] parents [about] this [a lot] [. But] children , [I] , [I] think working mothers or mothers who choose [to] work outside [the] _home_ , um , need [very] early [to] come [to] grips [with] any guilt , [that] they feel [and] decide what's best [for] them [and] their [family .] 
A|50| A: Yeah . Uh-huh . 
B|51| B: [And] [I] feel when [my] children were [very] young , [I] [had] jobs [that] helped me be flexible [with] [my] schedule [and] spend [time with] them [and] all [that] sort [of] thing [. And] [I] long ago decided I'm [a] better mother because [I] work outside [the] _home ._ 
A|52| A: Uh-huh . 
B|53| B: [I] _really_ believe [that] [. And] _it_ [has] , um , helped [us] [to] afford some things [for] [our] children [that] [we] couldn't otherwise [that] [I] think are wonderful particularly at this age [, and] [I] think [our] [kids] are real secure [. And] [have a] real sense [of] priorities [and] [that] they [can] [do] anything [and] be anything both male [and] female [a lot] 
A|54| A: Uh-huh . 
B|55| B: [so] [I] _know_ _it_ sounds _like_ [a] rationalization [but] it's , [I] _really_ think it's true [for] [our family] [, and] [I] think _it_ [has] [worked] [very] well . 
A|56| A: Yeah [. It's] [like] [you] [said] _, you_ [know _,] to_ each his [own] [. And] [we're] planning [on] having [my] _wife_ stay [home [.] And] [but ,] 
B|57| B: There's [no] question , [I] think [that's] _really_ [the] best . If , if [a] woman is happy doing [that ,] 
A|58| A: Uh-huh . 
B|59| B: [I] hate [to] put _it_ quite [that] way . 
A|60| A: Yeah . 
B|61| B: [I was] twenty-nine when [I] [had] [my] first child [and] [, uh ,] [I] would _not_ [have] [been] real fulfilled . [I] _really_ would _not_ [have] [been] totally staying [home] [with] [a] young child . 
A|62| A: Uh-huh . 
B|63| B: [It's] [a] wonderful , it's wonderful [to] be [a] mother [but [,] uh ,] [I] [like] [I] [like] [the] way [I] did _it ._ 
A|64| A: Right . 
B|65| B: [I] sort [of] [worked] [half] [time .] [I] [had] [very] flexible hours . [I] nursed all [three] [of] [our] children until they were at least [a] year [and] [I] [, you] [can] [do] [that] despite working [very] easily which is [one] [of the] things [I] preach all [the time] [to] [, to] mothers . 
A|66| A: [Oh .] Uh-huh . 
B|67| B: _Um [,_ and] [I] think [we] choose [very] , [very] carefully [the] , um , alternative situations [that] [we had] them [in] . 
A|68| A: Uh-huh . 
B|69| B: Some baby-sitting groups , again , [I] [know] _it_ sounds [like] [a] rationalization , [but] [I] _really_ [do] think sometimes they [very] early [on] are around lots [of] other children [and] they , they learn [to] share . They learn _not_ necessarily [to] be [the] center [of] attention [but] [that] at [the] same [time] [we] [have] [to] be sure they are secure . 
A|70| A: Uh-huh . 
B|71| B: [I] think [that] helps . 
A|72| A: [Well ,] [that's] good . Sounds [like] [you're] [, [have] a] handle [on] [it .] 
B|73| B: [Well ,] [so] , [so] [. So] , [your] [wife] , does she work _right now_ ? 
A|74| A: [Um ,] [no] , [not] [right now] . 
B|75| B: She's out , 
A|76| A: Right . [Well [,] we] [just] moved down [here [.] We] used [to] live up [in] Seattle [for] [a] couple [of] [years] . 
B|77| B: You're still [trying] [to] dry out ? 
A|78| A: [It's] [that's] [no] [problem] [here .] Yeah [, [we] really] liked [it] up [there] [but] then
