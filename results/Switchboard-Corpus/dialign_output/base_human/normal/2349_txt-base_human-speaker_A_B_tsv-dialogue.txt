B|0| B: _Okay_ . 
A|1| A: All _right ._ 
B|2| B: Um _, _I_ _,_ I_ understand _that_ _it's_ being proposed _as a_ requirement , _for_ , uh _, young_ people _to be _,_ to_ _go_ into _public service ._ 
A|3| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|4| B: _I think ,_ 
A|5| A: Yes , _all_ , _all_ [young] Americans _, they_ did _not_ specify _, you know _,_ exactly_ what [young] means . 
B|6| B: _Yeah , yeah _._ _I_ think_ _that_ _it_ _probably_ _would be a_ _, a_ _good_ program _. _I_ think_ _probably_ _two years_ _is_ _too long ._ 
A|7| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|8| B: _I think_ _maybe_ _a_ _year_ _would _be_ ,_ _the_ longest . 
A|9| A: _Yeah _. Yeah_ ,_ you're [probably] _right_ , [two years] _might_ [be _a] little_ [too long .] 
B|10| B: [Yeah _,] and_ _there_ will _be a lot of_ rebellion _in_ _that_ _and_ when [you] get people who _have_ no desire _to be_ _there_ _in the_ first place _, I don't_ _think_ _that_ they're going _to be_ serving anybody . 
A|11| A: _That's right ._ That _, _that_ _would_ be the_ problem . _Sure_ [would] . 
B|12| B: [Yeah .] So _I think_ _it_ _would be a_ _good_ _thing_ though _, to_ encourage other people who aren't _even_ aware [that] [they] can _do_ such [a] _thing_ . _to_ get _out there_ _and_ _do_ so . 
A|13| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh _._ Yeah _,_ or_ [maybe] offer _them_ _, you know ,_ _some_ sort [of] an incentive _to _do_ _it_ ._ Uh _, you know_ _college credit _,_ you know ,_ _something _,_ you know ,_ 
B|14| B: [Yeah .] _Right ._ 
A|15| A: _I'm not sure_ what _but_ , 
B|16| B: _Right ._ College [credit] _is_ [a] _good idea_ because , 
A|17| A: _I'm not sure_ [they] _need [to_ be _,] you know ,_ paid _, you know [,_ a] super [do] salary [of] any _kind_ . 
B|18| B: _Right ._ 
A|19| A: _but_ _that , _that_ kind of_ takes _away from_ [public service .] 
B|20| B: [That's right] [Yeah [,] they] [probably] _couldn't_ [do] anything monetary , [but] _I think ,_ giving , giving _some [kind_ of] [college credit ,] 
A|21| A: _But ,_ _just_ _, you know [,_ to] receive [a] letter [in the] mail _, that_ says _, you know _,_ you_ _need to_ report somewhere by next Monday _, you know_ [you] _need to_ report somewhere by next Monday _, you know_ . _I'm not sure _that_ [would_ be a] terrifically [good idea] . 
B|22| B: No _, I don't_ _think_ so _either_ because _a lot of_ people , um , depending _on_ how [the] [public service] _programs are_ set _up_ _and_ [I'm not] [that] familiar _with_ [them] [to] [know ,] 
A|23| A: [I'm not] [either] _really_ . 
B|24| B: [But [,] you know _,] _if_ [,_ a] [, _a] lot of_ people flat can't afford [to] . 
A|25| A: _That's right ._ 
B|26| B: You [know ,] 
A|27| A: _That's right ._ 
B|28| B: _and_ most kids these days _have_ gotten themselves into , uh , financial situations , where [they] _have to be_ working [all] [the] _time ._ 
A|29| A: _Uh-huh _._ That's right ._ Absolutely _. They_ _need_ [, young] families , whatever , 
B|30| B: So _, it's_ _, it's a_ [really] _tough question [._ That's right .] 
A|31| A: _they just_ [couldn't] [, you know ,] _take_ off _to do that ._ 
B|32| B: [Yeah ,] 
A|33| A: Oh , 
B|34| B: _and _,_ if_ [you] put [them] [in] [public service] [right] _out_ [of] high school , then [that , that] postpones _their_ [college] , _for_ [a] _year_ 
A|35| A: [That's right] , uh-huh . 
B|36| B: _and_ [that would] upset _a lot of_ people [too] , because [they just] want [to] get _on_ , 
A|37| A: _Uh-huh_ _, it_ _sure_ [would] _. It_ _would have to [be_ a lot of] [, you know ,] thought given [to] _something like [that_ [,] I] [would] [think] . 
B|38| B: _Yeah . I [,_ you know _,] I think_ [it] [would be] [good] _for_ [a lot of] people [to] get involved [in] [that kind of] program , 
A|39| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|40| B: [but] _I _,_ I think_ [it] can't [be] [something] _that's_ mandatory . 
A|41| A: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
B|42| B: [it] has [to be] [something] _that's_ voluntary . You [know ,] which _is_ pretty _much_ [the] _way_ [it] _is_ _now_ [. They] [might] , 
A|43| A: [That's right .] [I'm not] [even] [really] _sure_ at this point [in] _time [,_ you know ,] what , what [programs are] [out there] . 
B|44| B: [Yeah _,] and_ _that's_ [the] other _thing_ _is_ [that [,] you know ,] instead [of] making [it] mandatory [, they] [maybe] [need to] publicize [it] [a little] bit better . _and ,_ uh _, you know , go_ [to] [the] schools _and_ [do] [programs] _, and_ tell [them] [that] _we_ [need] _your_ help _, _and_ , you know ,_ uh , volunteer _for_ such _and_ such [a] [time ,] 
A|45| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|46| B: _and_ you've [a] choice [of] where [you] want [to] _go_ . 
A|47| A: [Yeah .] 
B|48| B: _and _,_ and_ [that] _way_ , handling [it] [that] _way_ _they could_ [probably] get [some] results [out] [of] [it .] 
A|49| A: [Yeah ,] _like_ [maybe] [if [,] if] [there] was [something] [they could] [do] _in their own_ , _own_ _, in their own_ town _or_ city [, yeah] [, and] [not] [have to] pull [up] roots [and [, you know ,] go] somewhere half [way] around [the] world _, _or_ something_ . 
B|50| B: [Yeah [,] in their own] community , _right . Yeah _, that's_ true_ Most [of] [them] [probably] wouldn't [do] [something _like that] ._ Although [there] [are] [a lot of] kids who [would] [do it] [just] [to] get [away from] [their] parents 
A|51| A: [That's [right .] Yeah , that's] [, that's true] _too [._ That's] [true] _too ._ 
B|52| B: [But [,] they] [would have to be] supported [in] [some] [way] [, and] [I'm not sure that] those [programs are] available [to do that .] 
A|53| A: [Yeah , yeah .] Me neither . And [, you] wonder [, you know ,] what [kind of] quality job [would] _they do_ [, you know ,] Just sit around [for] [their] [year] , 
B|54| B: _Right ._ 
A|55| A: _or_ [would] [they] [really] [, you know ,] make [a] contribution [of] [some kind] . 
B|56| B: _Right_ [, exactly] . 
A|57| A: [Yeah [,] it's] _tough . It's_ _tough ._ 
B|58| B: [Yeah [,] it] _is_ [tough . It's] [, and] _I don't_ [know] who's [even] proposing [it] [, or] [, or] how [they] plan _on_ implementing [it] [, if] [they do] . 
A|59| A: _Yeah . [Yeah . I_ ,] [I'm not sure] [either] . [But _,] I think ,_ [there] [would have to [be] a lot] _more_ [, you know ,] information [, you know ,] disseminated , before [you] say , let's [do] this [, you know] . 
B|60| B: [Yeah . Yeah . [I] think] going [to] [the] schools [would be the] easiest [for] [them] . 
A|61| A: [Yeah .] 
B|62| B: You [know [,] it] [be [,] it] wouldn't [take] [up] _much_ , _much_ [, it] [would] [take] [up] [more] [time] than anything [but] [it] wouldn't [take] [up] [a lot of] money . 
A|63| A: [Yeah .] 
B|64| B: [They] wouldn't [have to] spend money advertising [and] _things like that ._ 
A|65| A: [Yeah [.] That's right .] 
B|66| B: You [go] [to] school [and] [you] [have] [a] [kind of] [a] captive audience , get [them] [all] [in the] auditorium , 
A|67| A: [Yeah .] 
B|68| B: [and] [you] [, you] give [them] _your_ speech [and] [maybe] [a little] slide show [or [something] ,] 
A|69| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|70| B: [and [,] I think [,] that] [they could] get [some] results [from] [that ,] because [there] [are] [a lot of] people who [are] volunteer [and] community minded , 
A|71| A: [Right .] 
B|72| B: [but] [they] _don't_ [know] where [to] [go] [to] [, to] [, [to] do] anything . 
A|73| A: [That's [right [.] Yeah] [.] That's] [a] real waste _too _._ It really is ._ 
B|74| B: [Yeah [,] it] [is [.] It really is .] 
A|75| A: [I don't] [really] see [the] emphasis [on] [things like] Peace Corps , [like] [we] [, you know ,] [we] saw back [, I] guess [, [in] the] Carter administration , 
B|76| B: [Right .] 
A|77| A: [that] was [, that] was [a] big [thing] [with] him . 
B|78| B: [Yeah , yeah .] 
A|79| A: And [, I] guess [even] back [to] Kennedy , [as a] matter [of] fact [, I] guess Kennedy may [be the] _one_ [that] actually started [the] [thing] [, or] was [, you know ,] [really] interested [in] [things like that .] 
B|80| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: [I] [just] [don't] hear [much] about [it] anymore . Like [I] say [, I don't] [even] [know] what [programs are] , [are] [even] ongoing [now] [, you know] . 
B|82| B: [I don't] [either] [That's] [one] , 
A|83| A: Anyway [, it's _a] tough question ._ 
B|84| B: [Yeah [,] it] [is] [a tough question .] 
A|85| A: [Okay] , well thanks [for] [your] [time [.] I] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|86| B: [Sure] , same here . 
A|87| A: [Okay] , [take] care .
