B|41| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [and] [then] _, um ,_ actually _married_ [in Pittsburgh] [, and] that's , that's [not] _what they_ _want to_ hear _on_ this call _, uh_ 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: _at_ _any_ rate [we] came back _here_ with _, my husband_ was transferred _around_ _, uh ,_ _up_ _to_ Minnesota [and] _now_ back _to_ [Texas] with T [I] 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [and] _we're_ leasing [a] _, uh _,_ two_ story town _home_ [in] [a] section [of] Dallas _they_ call North Dallas .

B|53| B: _Uh-huh ,_ uh-huh . 
A|54| A: [you know [,] in] terms [of] , *listen; with previous slash unit ? [and] [in] terms [of] housing _down_ _here_ _, um [,_ [you] really] _have your_ pick [but] _it's_ [just] everything's overpriced _for the_ economy . 
B|55| B: [Oh [,] it's] _terrible_ [. _I] ,_ 
A|56| A: [It] [really] _is [,_ I] mean _we're_ _, we're_ [in] [a] leased town _home _,_ and it's [,_ uh _,] you're_ _probably_ _, your_ teeth will _probably_ fall [out] figuratively speaking [, it's] nine _hundred_ [a] month . 
B|57| B: _Oh , _I'm_ not_ surprised . 
A|58| A: [But] [, you know] _what_ , if [you] , if [you] _get_ anything under _five_ _hundred_ [you] _get_ into _what they_ call high density [living] [you know _,] the_ [big] apartment complexes 
B|59| B: [Uh _,] right _,_ right ._ _Right _, right_ ._ 
A|60| A: _and , and_ [I] [just] [have] _no_ tolerance [for] [that] . 
B|61| B: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] it's not] _good_ 
A|62| A: [No] . 
B|63| B: _And the_ _people_ _think_ [the] income [is] [really] _great_ [in] _some_ [of] those areas [but] _when they_ sit [down] _and look_ [at] _what it_ costs [to] [live] [and [,] uh ,] [of] course , most [of the] _homes_ [are] _, you know ,_ fairly _nice _,_ they're_ [, uh ,] done [up] fairly _nice [,_ uh ,] 
A|64| A: [Yeah] this _is , it's_ _like a_ duplex _, _like_ a_ [two] _by_ [two] [they] call [it] _like_ [in Pittsburgh] . 
B|65| B: _Right ,_ uh-huh , [Uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [And] [it's] [nice] [but] _it's [,_ I] mean _, the_ girl _bought_ [it] [for _a] hundred_ [and] _ten_ [, and] [now] she can't [sell] _it ._ [And] _our_ neighbors , 
B|67| B: _Well ,_ prices [have] _come_ [down] _on the_ _homes [,_ the] duplexes . 
A|68| A: [Yeah , I] mean , we'll _, our_ neighbors [, the] attached [on the] _other_ side [, they're] very [nice ,] thank God , 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: _they paid_ fifty-eight [for] _it ._ 
B|71| B: _Oh , my_ heaven . 
A|72| A: That's how _bad_ [it] _, I _know_ ._ 
B|73| B: _Well [,_ I know] [up] [in] Connecticut [the] _same_ [thing] happened , _people_ [are] devastated _because [they_ paid] _so_ much [for] _their_ [home] . 
A|74| A: That's [right _.] Uh-huh [,_ yeah [.] [I] have] [some] _friends_ [that live in] Westport _and _it's_ _really_ ,_ [really] _bad [._ I] mean [you] , 
B|75| B: [But] [we] [like] [our] [area] . [It] _, like I_ _said _,_ it's , [it's_ an] _old_ _house and_ everything 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: _but , uh ,_ 
A|78| A: How _far_ , where [is] [Clarion County] [in] relation [to] , actually _, because_ _we're_ considering moving [to] [Pennsylvania] 
B|79| B: _Well [,_ we're] _about a hundred [miles_ [from] Pittsburgh] _north ._ 
A|80| A: That's [not] _too_ _bad ._ That's [north .] 
B|81| B: [And] [yeah [,] and _it's _,] it's_ _really_ not_ _, you know _,_ _not_ that far_ . 
A|82| A: Are [you] going [up] toward _, uh , uh [,_ I'm] [trying to] [think] [of the] name _of that_ town [that] starts with [an] M , Bradford _, no_ that's _too_ [far] [north .] 
B|83| B: Bradford's [north] [of] [us .] 
A|84| A: So _you're_ _, you're [not_ that far] [north] [then] , okay . 
B|85| B: [No [,] no] . 
A|86| A: [Well _,] you're_ [really not] _too_ _bad [._ Yeah .] 
B|87| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: Um , was [it] [a home] [that] you've [had] [for] quite [a] few _years_ , _or_ [that] you've ,

B|93| B: [Oh ,] pardon _me _,_ we have_ forty [, we] gave [ten] [to] _one of_ [our] _children_ 
A|94| A: There [you] _go_ . Did _you [have_ a] hard [time] getting used [to] [, do you] feel [like] [you] [live in] [an] _isolated_ [area] _or_ , 
B|95| B: [No _,] not_ [really _,] and , and_ towns _keep_ creeping closer [and] closer _, you know ._ 
A|96| A: [Yeah _, I] think_ [that] that's _, um [,_ I] _can_ remember [in Pittsburgh] [when] , this [has] _to do_ with [homes [,] uh ,] indirectly [but] [I] _can_ remember [when] Upper Saint Clair was [out in the] [, you know [,] the] _rural_ end [of] Washington , 
B|97| B: [Uh-huh ,] uh-huh . 
A|98| A: [and] [now] [it's] [it's] [a] [terrible] connection . 
B|99| B: [Yeah [,] it's] ours [up] [here] . [We] [have [,] our] [rural] connections [are] _real_ [bad] 
A|100| A: [Oh _,] well_ that's okay _, um ,_ 
B|101| B: [But] [we _,] but_ [we] [live] [about] [ten] [miles from] [probably] _three_ [or] four _, not_ _large_ towns _but [,_ you know ,] reasonable . 
A|102| A: [But] [, [but] [,] yeah ,] substantially [, you know .] Um [, do you] [like] [living] [in] [an] older [home] [and] restoring [it] [like] [that] ? 
B|103| B: [Uh [,] yeah [,] we're] tired [of] doing [it] though . [We , we] _don't_ [want [to] do] [too] much [more] 
A|104| A: How [big] [is] [it] ? How _many_ square feet [do _you] have_ ? 
B|105| B: [Uh _,] oh ,_ golly [, I] [really] . 
A|106| A: [Well] how _many_ _rooms_ [do you] [think] [, yeah] ? 
B|107| B: [We] _have [, uh ,_ uh ,] four [rooms] downstairs [, _and] a_ pantry 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [and] upstairs _we [have_ a] bath _, a_ bath _, oh_ [we ,] [have _a] half_ bath downstairs , _too ._ 
A|110| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [We] [have a] bath upstairs [, and] _one_ [, two] , _three_ , four _bedrooms_ _and a_ sewing _room_ _and a_ _junk room_ [And , uh ,] 
A|112| A: A [junk room] [, yeah] [I] understand [, we have] [that] [too .] That's , that's [large] if _your_ [children] _aren't_ [at] [home] _any more_ . 
B|113| B: Pardon ? 
A|114| A: That's [large] if _your_ kids _aren't_ [at] [home] _any more_ . 
B|115| B: [Well _,] it_ [really] isn't [too] [big] yet . [We , we] [a _lot of] people say_ [that] _but _, um ,_ it's ,_ 
A|116| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|117| B: [we] [just] [like] [it] _real_ [well] [Yeah ,] 
A|118| A: [It's] _enough_ space [for] [two] [people] [Yeah .] 
B|119| B: _we had_ [five] [children] , _so_ _and they've_ _all_ moved [you know _,] on_ . 
A|120| A: [Oh ,] okay . 
B|121| B: They're _all_ [out] _on their_ _own_ [now .] 
A|122| A: [Yeah [,] right .] That's okay . [Well , we've] _got_ [, um ,] this town [house] [is] pretty [big] _. It's_ [about] eighteen [hundred] square feet _. It's_ _got_ [three] [bedrooms] [, two] [and [a] half] baths 
B|123| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|124| A: [um [, it's] really] _nice ._ 
B|125| B: [Well _,] it_ sounds [like a] _good_ [buy] . 
A|126| A: [Yeah [,] it] _is [,_ I] mean [, I] would never [buy] [it] [but] leasing [it] [is] fine . 
B|127| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: Um [, [but] [,] it's] [just] again [, the] [, the] privacy [, you know .] Um [, [we] had] [a] [house] [in] Minneapolis [that] was [on] [three] [acres] [, and] _my husband_ was raised [, um [,] on] [a working farm] near 
B|129| B: [Oh [,] that] makes [a big] _difference_ . 
A|130| A: [right ,] near Dayton , Ohio [, and] [he] [said [,] you know [,] he's] [, he's] slowly getting [me] [to] [, um [,] not] feel _isolated_ if [we] _move_ [to] where there's [more] land . 
B|131| B: [Uh-huh _.] You_ [really] [aren't] [isolated] [because] [it's [,] the] advantages [, your] [home] [is] [far] [enough] _away_ [that] [you're not] bothered [by] being [too] close [to] [people] , 
A|132| A: [Right] . 
B|133| B: [but] yet _you can_ [have your] [friends] _, uh _, you_ can_ [have] them [in] _, you can go_ [out] . 
A|134| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|135| B: _You_ [have] [more] [of] [a] choice [, you're not] pressed upon as [bad .] 
A|136| A: That's kind [of] [what] [, like] his parents [have , uh ,] land [that] [they] retired [to] [, um ,] [about a hundred miles] [out] [of] Atlanta [and [,] in] Georgia , 
B|137| B: [Uh-huh .]

B|139| B: [Uh ,] uh-huh [. [Uh-huh] .] 
A|140| A: [but , um [,] um [,] but] [I] mean _, _they_ have_ [one [of] the] [, um ,] [when they] [said] log cabin [, I] [just] laughed [, that] [they] retired [to] _, but they_ built [one of] these [. I] mean [, it's] [just] _beautiful_ _. It's_ [like a] custom [, you know] [it's not] [like] [what] [I] would [think] [of] [when] _I think_ [of] [old] log cabins [. _You] _know ,_ I_ mean [, it's] modern [it's ,] 
B|141| B: [More] luxury [. Uh-huh ,] uh-huh . 
A|142| A: [Right [, right] [,] it's] modern [, it's] _beautiful_ [, it's] [country] 
B|143| B: [Right [,] yeah .] 
A|144| A: [it's] [you know [,] um [,] _but] , uh , I don't_ , [what] else [about] housing except [it's [,] uh _,] well ,_ Pittsburgh's housing economy _, I think_ [it's] holding [it's] [own] . 
B|145| B: [Uh [,] they're] [, yeah , I] suppose [they] [are] [now .] [We ,] both [of] [our] [children] [who] [live] [there] [have] [just] [bought] [a home] . [Uh [,] [in] the] _Mount Lebanon_ [area] . 
A|146| A: [What part] , [what] sections [are] [they] [in] ? [Yeah ,] that's _nice ._ 
B|147| B: [And , uh [,] the] [one] [, the] [one] boy [, the] [house] [they] [bought] [is] completely livable . They didn't [have] [to do] much [to] [it .] 
A|148| A: Great . 
B|149| B: The [other] [one] _is [, uh ,_ uh ,] [has] [, you know ,] needs [more] work done [. It's] twenty [years] [old] [, I think] . 
A|150| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|151| B: [And [,] but [they] have] [two] [children] , [too] [, and] [they] [, they] [bought] [what _they] could_ afford . 
A|152| A: [Uh-huh .] That's [, yeah [,] a] [really] [good] friend [of] mine lives [in] Penn Hills [, [and] they've] [been] [in] [their] [house] [, oh ,] [probably] [about] twelve [years] [now] 
B|153| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|154| A: [and [,] um [, it's [,] it's] [,] you know [,] they're] going _to start_ [to] _see_ [their] return [on their] investment very soon . 
B|155| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|156| A: Um [, but] [it's] [a] _beautiful_ [home] [and [,] I] mean [, my brother] lives , 
B|157| B: They [are beautiful] [homes] . 
A|158| A: [is] [it] called Baldwin [or] Bebble ? 
B|159| B: [Uh-huh ,] uh-huh . 
A|160| A: [I] mean [, he] lives [all] [in] [that] [same] [area] going [from] [Mount Lebanon] [, um _, it's] real_ pretty [up] [there] [. It's] [just ,] 
B|161| B: [It] [is [, it's] real] [nice .] 
A|162| A: [And the] neighborhoods [are] stable [you know .] 
B|163| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|164| A: [It's] [, uh ,] _when you_ [come] [to] this [part [of] [the] country] [, we've been] [away] [from] Dallas [long] [enough] [that] [you] _see_ [the] [difference] [in] housing . 
B|165| B: [Oh , my] [you] [you] [do] [when you] When [we] first [got married] [, uh [,] my husband] works [for the] state [, [and] we] moved _once_ [a] year usually 
A|166| A: [Oh , my] goodness . 
B|167| B: [And] [then] after [they] [had] [to start] paying [to] [move] [us] [, that] suddenly wasn't necessary [any more] 
A|168| A: [Uh-huh .] That's [what it] [is] [here] [, yeah ,] that's why [we're] [at] [a] point [now] [we've] [, uh [,] we're] adopting [and [we] have] [been] [married] [ten] plus [years] [and] [what] happens [is [, uh ,] you] [just] realize [that] [once] [you] _get_ [to] [a] certain age [the] next [house] [that] [you] _get_ we'll be staying [in] [Yeah ,] 
B|169| B: [Right [,] yeah [,] [you] have] [to] stop [some] [place] [, yeah .] 
A|170| A: that's kind [of] [like] where [we're] , 
B|171| B: [Yeah .] 
A|172| A: [so] [we're] considering [Pennsylvania] [, and] [we're] [just] kind [of] [, you know ,] toying with [what] exactly , where [we] [want to] be [, you know .] 
B|173| B: [Uh-huh [.] I] [do] [too] , 
A|174| A: A [lot of people say] [it] doesn't matter where [they] [live] if [they [have] a] [nice] [house [and] [,] but] [I] disagree with [that] [, I] . 
B|175| B: I've heard [too] [many] [people say] [, I] hate [it] [here] . 
A|176| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|177| B: [You know [,] they] [buy] [a] [place] [and] [they] [just] hate [the] [area] . 
A|178| A: [I [know] [,] and] [it] [, and] [the] economy [here] [in] Dallas [, I] mean [, it] [, it's] steady [, but] [it's] still [not] going [up] . 
B|179| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|180| A: _And [I_ [,] um [,] I] [just] refuse [to] [buy] [it] [, um ,] if [I know] [I'm not] going [to] be [there] [for] [at] least [five] [years] [, uh , you] [, you know .] 
B|181| B: [Uh-huh [.] [Yeah] [,] well [,] my brother] [, they're] having trouble selling [their] [home ,] [see] . 
A|182| A: [Oh , I'm] sure [, yeah ,] [there] [, I] mean [, you can go] [down] [a] street [, and] [here] [, he] told [you] this , every [other] [house] [, you know ,] if [it's] [been] foreclosed [on] [or] [, you know ,] even [big] executives 
B|183| B: [Right ,] uh-huh . [Oh [,] yeah [,] yeah .] 
A|184| A: [um [, it's] [really] [,] I] mean [, and [, and] it's] hard [to sell] [the] properties . People [from] J C Penney's [from] New York , came [here] [about a] couple [of] [years] ago . 
B|185| B: [Uh-huh ,] uh-huh . 
A|186| A: [And] [they] thought [they] were getting [a] [great] deal [, um _,] [because_ [they] could] _get_ [a] [five] [hundred] thousand dollar [home] with [, they] call [it] , zero [lot] lines [, no] property , [And] [it] would make [you] ill [to] [see] this . 
B|187| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh [. Yeah .] 
A|188| A: [I] mean [it] would [probably] be [like] [your] [house] [on] [, uh _, you] know , [a_ half] [a] city block [in Pittsburgh] [or] something . 
B|189| B: [I [,] I] couldn't handle [that] 
A|190| A: [Yeah [, I] [know] [,] and] that's [, you know [,] like I] [can] [look] outside [right] [now] [and look] into [the] next unit . 
B|191| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|192| A: [You know [,] it's] across [the] way [, and it's] landscaped [and] [all] [that] with azaleas , 
B|193| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|194| A: [but] [it's] still [, it's] still [not that] private . 
B|195| B: [I] [get] tired [, uh ,] sometimes , mowing [, because we] mow [, you know , a] [good] bit [of] ground [around] [the] [house] [area] . 
A|196| A: [Yeah] [but [you] [have] a] rider . 
B|197| B: [And I] [do] [get] tired [of that] [but , uh , I don't] [know [, I] don't] [think] I'd [want to] change [it .] 
A|198| A: [No [,] and] [your] kids [have ,] [to] tell [you] [the] truth [, um [,] I think] [that] if [you can] [keep] [that] [, that] way [, you know ,] kind [of] [like a] homestead ,
