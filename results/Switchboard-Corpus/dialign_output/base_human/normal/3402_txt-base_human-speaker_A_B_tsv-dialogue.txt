A|0| A: All right _. I_ guess tonight's subject _is_ _to_ discuss current _events_ _and_ how _we_ keep up _on_ current _events_ _, and_ if we're satisfied _with_ , _with_ _the _,_ uh_ _coverage_ _that we_ receive . 
B|1| B: _Right_ . That's , _Right_ . 
A|2| A: _Um ,_ thinking _about it ,_ some _of_ _the_ ways _I_ _try_ _and_ keep up _on_ current _events_ _is_ _, uh _,_ I_ enjoy reading _the_ newspaper _, but_ _, uh ,_ quite often _don't_ _have_ _time_ _to read_ all _of_ _the_ newspaper _, and_ _so_ _, uh _,_ I_ enjoy _watching_ some _of_ _the_ _T V_ highlights _and_ also _, uh ,_ some _of_ _the news_ periodicals _, uh ,_ weekly magazines _, _and_ , uh ,_ _at_ work _I_ also _have_ _, uh ,_ management summary reports _that _,_ uh ,_ give _basically_ _a lot_ _of_ _the_ current _events_ . Uh , how _about_ yourself ? 
B|3| B: Well , I'm _like you_ _. I don't_ _, I don't_ [, I] _like_ [to read] [the] paper [but] [I] [basically] [don't] _do_ [it] every day _, and I_ _, um , I_ usually watch [, uh ,] either GOOD MORNING , AMERICA _or_ [the] TODAY SHOW , every morning _while_ I'm _, you know ,_ 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: whatever I'm doing [, I] watch _that [._ I] usually watch [the _news] ,_ either [at] _, you know ,_ early evening _or_ [at] ten o'clock 
A|6| A: [Right] , right . 
B|7| B: [so] [I] _get_ [it] _from_ [T V] [a lot] [. I] _get_ TIME _I read_ TIME MAGAZINE [Um ,] _that's_ one _I read_ _pretty_ regularly . 
A|8| A: Oh , yeah . Okay . 
B|9| B: _And , uh ._ The thing [about it _,] you know ,_ now [that] _I've_ _found_ _, is_ [that we] _get_ such _good_ [coverage] _on T V _,_ or_ [at] least such _, I don't know ,_ attempted thoroughness [of] [coverage] , by [the] [time] _you get_ [the] TIME MAGAZINE , there's nothing _in_ [it] _you_ _don't know ._ 
A|10| A: _You_ _think_ [that] [that's] [, uh ,] [pretty] adequate [coverage] [and] [you get] . _Uh-huh _._ It's_ historic _events_ , huh . 
B|11| B: [Right] . Then _you can_ just sort [of] [have] pictures _to go_ along [with] [it] _or_ _something_ , because really , _I've_ thought lately , there's nothing new _in_ [the] TIME MAGAZINE . 
A|12| A: Oh , okay . 
B|13| B: [You] _know , it's_ _, it's_ , [basically] you've _heard_ everything 
A|14| A: Yes . 
B|15| B: [and , uh _,] you_ might _, you_ might [get] [a] little _more thorough_ [, uh ,] account [of] _something_ [, but] really _, um _, I_ don't know _._ So_ [I] [get] most [of] mine _from_ _television_ 
A|16| A: Yeah . 
B|17| B: [I] _would_ say . 
A|18| A: [Um [,] I] [found] out _too _,_ _that_ [,_ uh ,] quite often if [I] _see_ [something] [on] [television] [that] [I] want [more] in-depth [, uh ,] understanding _or , or_ [get] , want [to] [know] [more] [about it _,] that_ _the _,_ the_ newspaper _or , uh [,_ [I] read] NEWSWEEK , [can] give [you] [a] better [and] [more thorough] [coverage] [of] what [I've] [heard] [on T V [,] but] [, uh [,] um , I] [found] out [that] also _on , on T V_ [that] [you can] scan through [a] whole [lot] [of] different _things_ [on] C N N [and [,] and] _like you said _,_ _the_ _,_ [the_ news] shows _that are_ _, _that_ are_ happening [, and] [you can] [read] some [more] [about it] if [you] want [to] . [Um [,] I] [found] out , though _that [,_ or] [I] feel [that] [a lot] [of] [the] _stuff_ [on T V] _and the_ newspapers [is] _negative_ . There's _an_ awful [lot] [of] _negative_ _news or_ _bad [news_ _,] _or ,_ or_ _bad news_ . [And] it'd be refreshing once [in] [a] [while] [to] hear some [good] [news] . 
B|19| B: [Right] 
A|20| A: [And , uh .] 
B|21| B: _and I_ [, _I] think_ there's [an] attempt [to] _do_ _that ._ [You] _know , _I_ think_ people , there's [a] mild attempt for [that [,] but] _I think_ [basically] _, we_ [basically] associate [news] [with] [bad [news] [or] , or] catastrophes [or] problems [or] crises [, [or ,] uh _,] you _know_ ._ 
A|22| A: Yes [, we] [do] . 
B|23| B: _I think_ our concept [of] [news] isn't necessarily [events] [that] happen [. It's] [more] [negative] _, [like_ you said] . 
A|24| A: True , true . 
B|25| B: But [, _I] think_ people [try] _to [,_ [on] , on T V] _I think_ , _they_ [try] [to] throw [in] [good] [stuff] [, but] [it] doesn't [, uh ,] [it] doesn't sway [the] vote . 
A|26| A: _Uh-huh ._ [I've] [heard] [an] interesting comment also [that [,] uh ,] [with] budget cuts [and , uh ,] expenses [the] way [they] _are_ [that] [it's] affected [the news] media , whereas before [they] [would] be able [to] [have] [a] in-depth analysis [or , uh ,] investigative reporting [, on] certain topics [and] issues [, but] [that] takes [time] _, that_ takes [an] awful [lot] [of] money [and] commitment [, [and] [,] and] quite often [it's] [a lot] easier [to] listen [to] [the] police scanners [or] what [they] call ambulance chasing 
B|27| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [and] [go] after [, you [know ,] it's] [lot] easy [to go] after [and] follow [a] fire department [or] [a] police officer [, [and] , uh ,] find out [news] [from] [that] as opposed [to] going out [and] finding [good] _things_ , [so] [. [I don't] [know ,] I] guess [the] economy [is] [, is] effecting also [the news] media 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [and] [we] [have] [to] pay [that] price [, but] [, uh [,] I don't [know [,] I] don't know [.] It's] interesting [, and [I] think] [that] nowadays [with] communications [the] way [they] _are_ also _, [that_ we] [can] _see_ global [events] happening as , as [they] occur all over [the] world [, like] _the ,_ 
B|31| B: [Right] . [You] [know [,] the] war last winter was certainly [a] [good] example [of] [that] because [we] _saw_ every single thing , practically . 
A|32| A: Exactly . We [saw] , Yes [, you know ,] twenty years ago , thirty years ago [, we] wouldn't [have] been able [to] [have] [that] privilege [or , or] luxury [to ,] [to] view [that [.] So] . 
B|33| B: [I] mean [, you [know ,] I] remember , well , just [the] [things] [that are] covered [. I] remember [watching] [the] World Series during [the] earthquake [, and] just seeing [that] happen 
A|34| A: Oh , yes . 
B|35| B: [I] mean [, you know [,] that] was just [so] phenomenal [to] [see] this stadium shake [and [the] [,] [and] the] announcers [, you know] grabbing , 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [I] mean [, it's] [like] [, that] was just [something] because [that] was [like] live [and] real [like you said ,] 
A|38| A: Oh , yeah . Yeah .
