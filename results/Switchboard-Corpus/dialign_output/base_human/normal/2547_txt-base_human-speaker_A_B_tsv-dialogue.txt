A|0| A: Okay . _What_ _, uh ,_ go ahead _and_ tell me _about your home_ 
B|1| B: _Well ,_ my [home] _at_ _the_ moment _is_ an apartment . 
A|2| A: _Oh _,_ is_ _that_ _right_ ? 
B|3| B: _Yeah_ _I_ work _here_ _in_ Germantown _, but_ _I_ _live in_ Pensacola , Florida . 
A|4| A: _Oh , that's_ interesting . 
B|5| B: _So _,_ I_ own _a _home_ in_ Pensacola _, and , uh ,_ let's see _, we_ _are_ _to_ compare homes . Correct ? 
A|6| A: Okay _. _Yeah_ ._ 
B|7| B: _Uh ,_ my [home] _is _,_ well [,_ is] _typical for the area ._ _I_ _live in_ _a_ development _, uh , _it's_ a_ relatively _, I_ _would_ _say _,_ well ,_ God _, it sounds like ,_ _sounds like_ I'm bragging 
A|8| A: _No _,_ that's_ okay 
B|9| B: But _it's_ upper middle class [, uh ,] _kind of_ an environment . 
A|10| A: Okay . 
B|11| B: _It's_ _a_ _two_ story colonial , which my wife [and] _I_ _designed_ . 
A|12| A: _Oh , that's_ neat . 
B|13| B: _Uh _,_ it_ _has_ _around_ thirty-two _hundred square feet_ . _Uh ,_ five _bedrooms and_ _so_ forth [and] _so_ _on_ , 
A|14| A: Wow _, that's_ large 
B|15| B: [and] _it _is_ _,_ I_ _would_ imagine _in_ terms _of , of_ size [and] _so_ forth _, it's_ relatively _typical for the area ._ _It_ might _be_ _, I_ _would_ _say_ _it's_ _probably_ midsized _for the area ._ There _are_ some smaller _, and_ _there_ _are_ _, you know ,_ several larger . 
A|16| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: _And [,_ uh _,] but_ based _, you know ,_ _in_ terms _of _,_ you know ,_ _in_ , _in_ Pensacola , _in_ [that] _area_ _of_ Florida _it _,_ uh , it's_ _what_ _now_ _, _it_ _is_ [,_ uh ,] _probably_ ten _years old_ . 
A|18| A: _Oh [,_ well _,] that's not_ too bad , 
B|19| B: [Yeah .] 
A|20| A: _that's_ _still_ fairly _new_ . 
B|21| B: _And_ _so_ _it's ,_ _in_ terms _of_ cost _and _,_ and _,_ and_ size [and] _so_ forth _, it _,_ uh , the_ _you know ,_ _housing_ _there_ [is] extremely affordable _, and , uh ,_ compared _to_ other parts _of the_ country _, you know ,_ let's _say_ compared _to_ Maryland [that] _same_ _house_ _here would_ _probably_ cost three-quarters _of a_ million dollars 
A|22| A: [Well ,] 
B|23| B: _but ,_ 
A|24| A: _Oh ,_ you're kidding [Well ,] _do_ [you] mind _if I_ ask [what] [it's] worth down [there] [, _I] mean _,_ what_ [it's ,] 
B|25| B: [I] _really_ haven't [, I] _really_ haven't [, uh ,] _when_ _we_ _built_ _it_ ten _years_ ago _, it _was_ , it_ ran _around_ _a hundred and_ _forty thousand_ dollars . 
A|26| A: Okay . 
B|27| B: _So [,_ _I] , I_ _would_ _have_ _really_ [, I] haven't _really_ priced _, you know ,_ _in the_ market _, so _I_ ,_ 
A|28| A: [It] [, it sounds like [,] _I] mean ,_ _from the_ way _you described_ [it] [a home] [like] [that] [here _would] be_ [at] least [two] [hundred and] _fifty thousand_ 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: _I mean ,_ _Dallas_ _is _a_ very_ marked up [area] , although _right now_ [it's _a] lot_ _lower_ um , _because of_ all [the] layoffs [and] everything 
B|31| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: [the] economy _around here is_ _real_ poor 
B|33| B: [I] thought [that] _was_ _on_ [the] upswing again [now] . 
A|34| A: [Well ,] _no_ , _not_ [really] 
B|35| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: Um [, [the] area] itself [, uh , the] Fort Worth _Dallas_ [area] , um _, has_ become [kind of] depressed _because_ there's _been_ [so] many layoffs _with_ big companies , including Texas Instruments 
B|37| B: Yes . 
A|38| A: Um , there's _been_ tremendous amounts [of _, of] [,_ uh ,] layoffs _so ,_ [really] [housing] [is] _real_ bad . The economy itself _around here _is_ not_ too terribly bad [, but] [housing] [is] _still_ _real_ bad 
B|39| B: [Uh-huh] 
A|40| A: [Yeah .] 
B|41| B: [Well ,] Pensacola [has] [it's] [really] [is a] buyer's market [there] [now] 
A|42| A: [Yeah .] _This [is_ ,] 
B|43| B: _And_ [it] isn't [because _of] the [,_ well _,] there_ [has] [been] _a lot of_ speculative building . _Uh [,_ _I] don't know ,_ perhaps [not] _in_ [Dallas] , 
A|44| A: _Oh_ . 
B|45| B: _but [,_ uh ,] I'm _sure_ people _in_ [, uh _,] you know ,_ _in_ [, uh ,] Galveston [and] [so] forth [would be] knowledgeable [about] _it [,_ uh ,] Pensacola [is a] Navy town . 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: _And_ [home] porting _was_ [a] possibility [a] few _years_ ago . 
A|48| A: _Oh_ . 
B|49| B: They _were_ expecting an influx [of] _something_ _on_ [the] order [of] [fifty thousand] people _or_ _more_ [from the] Navy , 
A|50| A: Wow . 
B|51| B: [a] [new] carrier _was_ coming _in_ _and [, uh ,_ _the] [,_ uh ,] attendant [, uh ,] support vessels . [Well [,] that's] [no] longer [, the] case . 
A|52| A: [So ,] _do_ [you] _think_ [, it was] overdeveloped then ? 
B|53| B: [Oh _,] it's [,_ _it] is_ . [I mean [,] _the] [,_ the] number [of] single family units _on_ sale [is] phenomenal compared _to_ [the] population . 
A|54| A: Wow . 
B|55| B: _And_ [so] overbuilding [is [,] has] [been] [a] [real] problem [there] . 
A|56| A: Um . 
B|57| B: [So] [you] can [still] get [a] , get [a] , [a] good _house_ _for [a_ very] , [very] reasonable price . _And_ [I mean] good [, I] [would] , let's _say_ _typical_ , _say_ _three_ _bedroom_ [, uh ,] [two] [and] [a] half baths , _on_ [a] half acre _or_ [so] [of] land [uh ,] reasonable construction [would] _probably_ run [you] [, uh _,] right now_ anywhere between , somewhere between _a hundred and_ _a hundred and_ _forty thousand_ dollars . _And_ _probably ,_ perhaps , cheaper , depending upon [the] neighborhood . 
A|58| A: Um _yeah _._ [Yeah_ .] 
B|59| B: [What] [about your home] ? 
A|60| A: [Well [,] right now] we're _just_ renting [, but] [it [is] [a] home] . Um , 
B|61| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [it's a] _four_ [bedroom] [home] _It has_ _about _,_ I guess_ , eighteen [hundred square feet] [It's] [on] _one_ floor 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [Uh [,] we] [have] [no] basement [I don't know ,] 
B|65| B: Nor [do] [we] _, but ,_ 
A|66| A: Okay [I] wasn't [sure] . Most [of the] ones [, you know ,] up _north_ [and] everything [do] [, but ,] um , anyway _, it's [, uh ,_ it's] pretty , also pretty [typical for the area .] Most [of] _this_ [area] [was] developed _, this_ [house] [was] [built] [in] seventy-four . 
B|67| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [So] _most_ [of the [,] it's] _almost_ _twenty_ [years old] [, and] _most_ [of the] houses _around here_ [were] [built] pretty _much_ _the same_ style [Uh [,] we] [have] [a] friend [that] lives [two] blocks _over_ [, and] his [house] [is] _almost_ identical [to] us , except his [is] [three] [bedrooms and] ours [is] _four_ 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [but] otherwise [the] layout [is] pretty _much_ _the same_ . [So] _I , I think_ _most_ [of] them [are] [there] [was [, it] ,] [like] _most_ _areas_ [that] [are] [built] , um [, there] [were] [probably ,] [like] [two] [or] [three] styles [you] could choose [from] 
B|71| B: _Right ._ 
A|72| A: [And [,] and , uh [,] that's] pretty _much_ all [the] houses [in [the] area] _, for_ [probably] [a] [square] mile , I'd [say ,] [at] least _, maybe_ even _a little bit_ [more] _than that_ . 
B|73| B: [Well [,] the] [housing] [here] [in] Maryland [is] [just] atrocious . [And] [in] , [in the] entire D C [area .] I'm , I'm _only_ [about [,] uh ,] twelve miles [or] [so] [from [the] [,] uh ,] border [of] Washington D C [, and] Montgomery County , Maryland [is] [probably] [one] [of the] [most] expensive , places [to] , 
A|74| A: Where [are] [you] [in] relation [to] _Sevren_ ? [are] [you] close [to] _Sevren_ ? 
B|75| B: [No [,] we] [are] west . 
A|76| A: Okay . 
B|77| B: [Sevren] [is] east , near [the] eastern shore , 
A|78| A: [Well [,] I] [just] , 
B|79| B: [if I] _had_ , 
A|80| A: [I] [have] [a] sister [that] used [to] [live in] [Sevren] . 
B|81| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [And] _they_ bought _their_ [home in] [I , I] want [to] [say] [like] [around] nineteen seventy-five [or] [something] [like] _that [,_ and] _they_ paid [like _,] they_ _, they_ [had] [it] [built] [from] [, you know _,] they_ _, they_ [designed] [it] [and] everything [, and] [to] [have] [it] [built] _they_ [only] paid [forty thousand] [for] [it [,] and] [when] _they_ left [the area] _they_ sold [it] [for [a] hundred and] _twenty_ [thousand] 
B|83| B: [Oh [, that's] not] unusual _, yeah ._ 
A|84| A: _Yeah [,_ so I] [just] wondered [, you know ,] [if] [the] whole [area] [was] [like] [that] [or] , 
B|85| B: [Well _,] that's ,_ [that] [area] [over] [there] [is not] as expensive as [in [the] [,] the] immediate [, you know ,] Washington [area .] 
A|86| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [And] [so [,] we] [, uh [,] I] [was] [just] looking [, for] example [there] [is a] [, uh ,] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex where [I] [live] [, and] [I] [was] [over] [there] recently looking [at] [the] possibility [of] buying [a] [two] [bedroom] condominium . [And] ninety-two [thousand] dollars [for a] [two] [bedroom] , which [is] essentially [a] [two] [bedroom] apartment . 
A|88| A: Um . 
B|89| B: Now [, it was] [very] nicely done . 
A|90| A: [Yeah .] 
B|91| B: [I] [would] [have] thought , 
A|92| A: Sounds [like] [a lot of] _money_ though 
B|93| B: Yes . [I , I] can't [, I] can't envision spending [that] [much] [money] [, and] [on] , [on] [something] along those lines . 
A|94| A: [sure] _. [Yeah_ .] 
B|95| B: [So [,] you know [,] it's [,] I guess] [you] pay [the] piper [but ,] Plus [the [,] [the] [,] the] taxes [around here] [are] phenomenally , high . 
A|96| A: [Right .] [Oh [,] yeah .] 
B|97| B: [Uh [,] [for] [the] [,] and] [so [,] you] , [on] [that] [it's] [not] unusual [, for] example [, for] somewhere [around here] [on] [a] , [on] [a] , [on] [a] [, what] [we] [would] [, you know [,] what] [you described] as [your] [house] [and] [what] [I] [would] describe as my [house] [say [,] for] example , [in] Pensacola , Florida , [on] [that] [house] [with] [the] homestead exemption [and] [so] forth [and] [so] [on] , might pay [three] [or] [four] [hundred] dollars [a] year taxes . [maybe] [, you know [,] maybe] [a little bit] higher [than that] [now] , 
A|98| A: Wow _. [Yeah_ .] 
B|99| B: [but] [that] [same] [house] [here] , you'd pay [almost] six [thousand] dollars [a] year , taxes [on] [it] . 
A|100| A: Wow Wow [, that's ,] 
B|101| B: [So [,] it's , uh [,] [so] [,] the] question [of] whether [to] buy [here] [or] move [to] another county , [say ,] drive [twenty] [more] miles [north] , buy [a] condominium [for] approximately [, uh , [the] same] price [, maybe] [a little] [lower] [, but] [the] taxes [would be] [, you know ,] perhaps [, maybe] one-third [uh [,] of ,] 
A|102| A: Really ? That [much] [of a] difference ? 
B|103| B: [Oh ,] absolutely [. [Yeah] ,] 
A|104| A: Wow . 
B|105| B: [so [,] it's [,] it's] [really] sad 
A|106| A: [Yeah] 
B|107| B: [This is] [one] [, this] [is] [one] [of the] [most] highly taxed [areas] [in the] country . 
A|108| A: Wow . Why [is] [that] ? Do [you know] ? [I mean] 
B|109| B: [Well [,] they] [it [,] [the] ,] [their] [, they] [do] [have] an extremely good , such things as extremely good school systems [, for] example . [It has] [one] [of the] best school systems [in the] country . 
A|110| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|111| B: [Uh [,] and] [because] [the] cost [of] living [around here is] [so] high , 
A|112| A: [Oh] . 
B|113| B: public employees make great salaries [around here] 
A|114| A: [Oh] 
B|115| B: [I] [was] reading [just] recently where [the] [typical] administrator [in [the] ,] Montgomery County Public Schools makes [, and] I'm [not] [, this] [is [,] uh , the] figure , he makes eighty [thousand] dollars [a] year . 
A|116| A: My goodness 
B|117| B: That's , 
A|118| A: Wow 
B|119| B: [and] [I ,] by administrator [I , I think] [I mean [,] [I] [,] they] didn't [, they] did [not] define [it [,] but] [for] example , [a] curriculum supervisor [or] principal [or] someone [, you know ,] [in] [that [,] uh ,] [in] [that] range .
