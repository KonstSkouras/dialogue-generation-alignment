A|0| A: So _, what_ _do_ _you _think_ about_ _a year_ _or_ _two_ _of_ public _service_ ? 
B|1| B: _Well _,_ _I_ know_ _it's_ hard _for_ _young people_ _to_ [think about] giving _up_ _their_ _years_ _, you know _,_ their_ _carefree_ _years_ 
A|2| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _but_ _people_ _that_ _I_ _have_ _known_ _that_ _have _done_ _that_ ,_ _like_ _from_ _other_ countries , especially _, from_ Germany _and_ Finland _, um , they_ _are_ _just _,_ they_ _have such a_ better , more mature , outlook _on_ _life_ 
A|4| A: _Yeah ._ _Yeah ._ 
B|5| B: _and I think_ _they're_ better _people_ _because _of_ _it_ ,_ 
A|6| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: _they're_ _much_ more responsible _. I _know_ _,_ um _,_ the_ _church_ _that_ _I_ go _to , um _,_ the_ _young_ men give _two _years_ of_ _their_ _life_ _when_ _they_ turn nineteen _, you know ,_ 
A|8| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: _they're_ encouraged _to do_ _that ,_ missionary work _, and I_ _I really_ believe _that the_ _people_ _that_ [do] _that_ _are_ better _people_ _that_ _make_ _our_ , society better . 
A|10| A: _You _know _,_ I_ , [I_ really] agree _with_ _you ._ _Um_ _, I _,_ uh ,_ though _I've_ never [done that] myself _, I ,_ I'm , _was_ [a] basically _an_ education major _when I_ graduated [from] college [and I] accepted [a] job [that] _at_ [the] _time_ _was_ [just] slightly above [the] poverty level [to] teach [to , um ,] very rural children _in a_ very low income district [and I] spent _a year_ teaching _there_ 
B|11| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: [and I think] [it] _was_ probably one [of] _my_ largest eye-opening experiences [because] _I come_ [from] nice middle class white suburban _home_ 
B|13| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [and I] did [it [,] um _,] for_ one reason [I] _wanted_ [, _I] was_ working [on] [a] masters degree _so_ [I] _wanted to_ stay close [to] where _I was_ working [on] [a] masters degree _, but_ also [because] [I] [just] thought _that it would_ _be_ interesting [to] live _some_ place else _so_ totally different _than_ _my_ _own_ [up] bringing 
B|15| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|16| A: [and _I] _,_ it_ changed _, it_ probably changed _my_ political views [it] changed _my_ understanding _of the_ world around me 
B|17| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: [and _I think] [,_ um _,] in_ fact _, if_ _I had_ _to do it_ _all_ again _I [,_ you know ,] _after_ [that [,] you know [,] you] never [think] [of _it] because _,_ I guess_ [because] [I] paid [for] _all_ [of] _my_ college education myself [, I] never thought [about] _doing_ [that] [because] _I had_ _all_ these college loans I'd started paying back . 
B|19| B: Huh . 
A|20| A: _Um_ , _so_ [that] _was_ _, that_ _was_ one reason why [I] never considered [it] [but] now [that] I'm further along [, and] I'm _still_ paying these college loans _, I _, I_ think_ realistically [, you know [,] _you] can_ [have] _your_ college loans delayed now _, because_ _I had_ _them_ delayed [because] I'm back _in_ graduate _school_ _at_ thirty [years] old , 
B|21| B: [Yeah .] 
A|22| A: _um , _I_ had_ _them_ delayed [because] I'm back _in_ graduate _school_ [and] [on] [that] form [it] says _if_ _your_ joining [the] Peace Corps _you can_ [have] _them_ delayed 
B|23| B: Huh . [and] rattling [in] 
A|24| A: [and I] thought [that] _was_ [, you know ,] very interesting [and _I] , I_ _would_ [have] thought [of] [that] earlier [I] probably _would_ [have done] [, you know ,] [just] [like] , _is_ [that ,] _is_ _this_ , _is_ [that the] Mormon _church _,_ that_ does [that] ? 
B|25| B: Yes . Yes . 
A|26| A: _Because_ one [of] _my_ neighbors _, uh ,_ did [that] [in] Pittsburgh [, from] Pittsburgh . 
B|27| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: _And_ [I] thought [, you know _,] that_ _really ,_ now [that] I'm thirty [years] old _, _I think_ that_ one _or_ [two years] _out_ [of] _my_ [life] _would_ [have] , probably [like] [you] said , _to be_ able [to] travel _some_ place else whether [it] _be_ [the] United States _or_ outside [the] _country _,_ I think_ _it would_ [have] been [a] very _good_ [, um ,] experience [for] me . 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] _Well [,_ I think] [so] [, it] puts [you] [out] [on] [your] [own] [and] [and] [in a] [time] [after] _high school_ [, um ,] there's kind [of] [a] selfishness , 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [I] mean , teenagers _in our_ [country] _are_ kind [of] , kind [of] [a year] [that] parents _don't_ look forward [to] _and , and_ _things_ [like] [that] 
A|32| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: [and [I think] [that] it would] _help_ _people_ [to] become , less self-centered [, and] [to be] more responsible [when] you're [out] [on] [your] [own] trying [to , um ,] thinking less [of] [your] [own] _needs_ [but] , [of] _other people_ . 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah _.] And_ _I think [,_ you know _,] we_ [have such a] _need_ now _, you know , I_ taught _, you know _, I_ [, I_ think] _I was_ paid _, uh ,_ [about] nine thousand dollars [to] teach [for] [the] [year] 
B|35| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [and I] worked [in a] very rural [school] district [and _I] _, I_ ,_ one _of the_ [things] [I] taught _was_ [a] computer class 
B|37| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [and] these _kids_ _, um , you know ,_ every girl [I] taught , except [for] one , _was_ pregnant . 
B|39| B: _Oh ,_ no . 
A|40| A: Many _of the_ boys [in] [the] room _had_ children _and they_ were [, they] were [high school] juniors . 
B|41| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: _And_ [I] [just ,] _there_ [, you know [,] they] came [from] poverty [, they] were _going to_ condition [in] poverty [and] [it] _was_ [, it] _was_ [, the] [school] district couldn't hire _many people_ [, it] _was_ very difficult [for] _them_ [to] hire [, [and _I] think] [,_ you know _,] in_ [the] sense _, that_ aspect [of] public _service_ [for] education [in] _some_ _of the_ inner cities _for [,_ um ,] [just] social workers [in] _some_ _of the_ inner cities [and] _some_ _of the_ rural areas where _they just_ _need_ advice [on] medical [, um ,] [things] [, I _think] it's_ [a] [really] _good_ _idea_ _. And_ even _if_ _it is_ overseas . 
B|43| B: _Right . Uh-huh ._ 
A|44| A: See [, I] never _, I , I_ tell [you] sometimes [I] worry [about] [things] over seas [because] _we_ [have such] problems _right_ _here_ [in our] [own] [country] . 
B|45| B: Yes . 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: It [would] [really [,] um [,] and I] _don't_ [the] [people] [that] [I've] _known_ [like] [from] Germany [and] Finland [that] [have [done] that] _are_ [, they] [do] _military_ [service] which [, you know , I] _don't_ exactly recommend 
A|48| A: _Yeah . Uh-huh ._ [Yeah .] 
B|49| B: [but] [still] [they] [have] benefited [from] [it] . 
A|50| A: [Right . Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: _And [,_ um , you know ,] although [I] wouldn't want [it] [to] _make_ [people] [to] go off [to] _the military_ voluntarily [but] [it's] [, _it] has_ helped [them] 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [and they] _are_ [just] _a lot_ more mature , [than] [the] average student 
A|54| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [and] [like] she's washing 
A|56| A: [Yeah [.] [I] think] [it would] also [help] [them] _if_ [they] then went [on] [to] college [. I _know] _that_ my_ first couple [of] [years of] college were [, um _,] uh ,_ probably _too_ [carefree] _at_ [the] , beginning 
B|57| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [and] then _at_ [the] end _I had_ [to be] _too_ serious . 
B|59| B: _Well _,_ that's right ._ A _lot of_ [people] [they] flunk [out] [or] [they] get [, [they] just] get [so] excited [to be] away [from] [home] [, [they] just] _spend_ [all] [there] [time] partying 
A|60| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
B|61| B: [and they] [do] _a lot of_ [things] [to] themselves [that [,] _that] we_ [really] _don't_ want [our] _young people_ [to be] [doing] 
A|62| A: [Yeah] [, that's] _true ._ 
B|63| B: _and ,_ 
A|64| A: [Uh-huh] [, that's right .] 
B|65| B: [Um] . 
A|66| A: _I ,_ yeah _, I think [,_ I think] _this_ _was_ , _this_ _was_ [a] very interesting topic _uh , because_ [it's] something [that [,] you know _,] we_ [don't] talk [about] _in this country_ probably _enough_ . 
B|67| B: [Yeah . Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: Uh [, you know ,] 
B|69| B: [because] we're [so] [, we] love [our] freedom [and] [our] freedom [of] choice _and , um ,_ _having_ [people] [like] 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] [, that's] _true ._ 
B|71| B: But [, you know ,] [our] , [like] [in our] [church [,] [it] [,] [it] is] , [your] free [to do] [that] [or] not 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: you're encouraged [to do [it] because [,] um , you know [,] [it] [,] it] helps [you] [, _and] ,_ [of] course [, we] [think it's] helping _other people_ . 
A|74| A: [Oh [,] I think] [it is] . 
B|75| B: [And] [so] , 
A|76| A: [I really] _think _,_ I think [,_ um ,] [people] [, you] should _, I [,_ you know [,] the] _kids_ today [I] teach [, I] [spend] [a lot of] _my_ [time] teaching college students 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [and _, um ,] I_ find great disgust [in] [them] _, _in_ their_ _, _in_ their_ [, um [,] their] self-centeredness [and] [their] inability [to] understand [, um ,] multicultural [or] multiracial situation 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: [and [I] [really] [,] you know _,] they don't_ understand _, uh ,_ _how_ [other people] live [, um _, they] don't_ understand , 
B|81| B: [And] _they're_ preoccupied [with] , drinking . 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] [, I _think] that's_ _, uh ,_ [just] [having] [a] _good_ [time] . 
B|83| B: [Uh-huh [.] And] 
A|84| A: _I _,_ uh _,_ a_ friend [of] mine [is] [a] psychologist [and] he always refers [to] [it] as short-term pleasure oriented [. _I] guess_ he's [a] technical aspect he likes [to] apply [to] [it [,] you know ,] 
B|85| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: today's [young people] [are] short-term pleasure oriented , 
B|87| B: _That's_ [true .] paper 
A|88| A: [and] everything [has] [to be] _an_ immediate reward [and] [it has] [to be] fun . 
B|89| B: _That's_ [really] [true .] 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|91| B: [Yeah .] _Well [,_ I , I] [don't] [know] [how] [that] [would] ever happen [here] [but] [at] least [, um ,] 
A|92| A: [Well _,] they say_ [, I think] [I [,] um ,] [have] read recently [that _,] uh [,_ the] Bush Administration [has] increased [the] funding [for] [the] Peace Corps . 
B|93| B: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|94| A: [Uh-huh .] _Because_ _I guess_ [because _of] the_ changes [in] Eastern Europe _, uh ,_ they've increased funding [for] [the] Peace Corps . Some _of the_ _, I guess_ [it's] _some_ _of the_ peace dividend [in] [the] sense [, you] [known] , 
B|95| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [when] [they're] decreasing _some_ _of [the_ military] spending , _some_ [of] [that] _money_ [has] gone into [the] Peace Corps 
B|97| B: Huh . 
A|98| A: [and] _some_ _of the_ [are] [the] overseas programs . Uh , 
B|99| B: [Well [,] I] [have] seen [a] big change [, I think [,] in] [high school] [kids] [that my] relatives [and] friends [, [that] [,] um , [I] know] [when [I] was] [in] [high school] [I had] [an] [idea] [of] [what] [I really] [wanted [to] do] [with] [what] [my] [, what] [I was] [going to] study 
A|100| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [and] [at] least [I had] [some] interest _in [,_ [a] lot [of] the] youth [that] [I come] [in] contact [with] [are] [, they say] oh [, I] want [to be] [a] doctor [, I] want [to be] _a lawyer_ . Why ? [Because] [they] _make_ [a lot of] [money] . 
A|102| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah] [, that's] [true .] 
B|103| B: [And] [they don't] [have] [a] goal [, they don't] [have] [a] goal [, they don't] [have] [an] interest [in their] [own] field [of] study . 
A|104| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|105| B: They're [just] looking what's [going to] pay [the] biggest cash . 
A|106| A: [Yeah] [, that's] very [true .] _You know ,_ [how] _many_ , [is] [it] [they say] [we] [have] [so] _many_ _lawyers in this country [,_ and _I] guess_ [, I , I] live near Washington , being [in [,] in] Baltimore , [it's] something [like] one [in] four [people] [, in] [the] Washington , area , [are] _lawyers_ , 
B|107| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|108| A: [And [,] and I] [just] sort [of] _think that's_ ridiculous . 
B|109| B: Yes . 
A|110| A: [Yeah] , [with] [with] [the] great [needs] [that we] _need_ today [in] science [and] biology [and _,] uh [,_ you know [,] the] [, the] problems [we] [have] [with] AIDS [and] cancer [and , and] [how] [come] everybody [is] [a lawyer] [, you know [,] you know] 
B|111| B: There's [just] [too] [many people] [. Uh-huh .] _That's_ [right .] Not [enough] [people] want [to do] [that] [to [,] [for] [,] [uh ,] [because] of] [a] [service] [that] [they] could provide . 
A|112| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
B|113| B: [You know [,] if] [you] want [to be] [a lawyer] [because] [you [know] that] [you can] provide [a] [service] [that] [people] [need] [because] [you] [have] [to] [have] [lawyers in this country [,] um [,] but] [if] you're [just] [doing] [it because] [you [think] that's] [the] best way [to ,] [be] rich . 
A|114| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] [, you] saw , statistics [that] [lawyers] [and] doctors [make] [the] most [money] [in] [the] long run . 
B|115| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [Yeah] [, that's] [true .] 
B|117| B: _That's_ kind [of] sad . [Well ,] anyway . 
A|118| A: [That's] interesting [. Uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: [Well [,] I guess] [I] better go . 
A|120| A: Okay . Hey , thanks [so] [much] [for] [the] conversation .
