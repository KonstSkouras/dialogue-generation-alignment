A|0| A: Okay . _So_ _, uh ,_ Mike , _what_ _are_ _your_ opinions _on_ _, uh ,_ trial _by_ _jury_ ? 
B|1| B: _Well_ I _work_ _for_ _an_ _insurance_ company so I see _a_ lot _of_ [, uh ,] verdicts _that_ [are] pretty crazily decided . Um , [by] juries particularly , and I know _in_ England _the_ judges set all _of the_ awards . You know juries _will_ decide _the_ guilt _or_ innocence , _but_ then _they_ _leave_ _the_ awards _up to_ _more_ learned people . And I _think_ maybe _that_ avoids _some_ _of_ these totally ridiculous , _you_ know _, like_ millions and millions _of_ dollars 
A|2| A: Uh-huh _. Yeah ._ That _, that_ seems [to] make _sense_ [but] [leave] _it_ [up _to] the_ [more] experienced _person_ who knows _how_ _it_ fits _into _the_ [,_ uh ,] _kind [of_ the] rate [for] different . 
B|3| B: _Oh ,_ exactly . Each individual [jury] really doesn't _have_ any perception [of] [what] , um , [the] _going_ , _you_ know _, if_ _you_ _will_ [the] _going_ [, uh ,] award _should_ be [for] _a_ certain _type_ [of] case , _you_ know , within _some_ [kind of] range . 
A|4| A: Uh-huh . 
B|5| B: When _you_ _get_ one way _out_ _like_ [that] [but] then really doesn't wind [up] penalizing [the] [person] [that] _they_ went after . _Who_ [it] really penalizes is _their_ _insurance_ company which then translates [into] higher rates [for] all [of] us . If _they get_ _some_ [of] those mega awards against them . 
A|6| A: Right . 
B|7| B: You know , they're not _going to_ sit there and lose money . If _they_ [are] _losing_ money , then they're _going to_ raise rates . 
A|8| A: Right . [they] 
B|9| B: [So] [it] all comes filtering down [to] us all individually . 
A|10| A: Right . 
B|11| B: And [, uh ,] granted _some_ people need [to] be compensated _if they have_ really been wronged , _you_ know . 
A|12| A: _Well _,_ how_ _do_ [you] feel _about_ setting [, like] , well _, for_ example _, a_ car [type] _accident_ _where_ [, uh ,] [or] [some] incident _where_ someone loses [a] _limb_ . Do [you] [think] [the] [jury] _should have_ [a] dollar figure [for] [losing] [an] arm _, a_ dollar figure [for] [losing] different body parts ? 
B|13| B: I don't know . You know [some] [of the] health _insurance_ is written [that] way . You know [, that] [, uh _,] if_ [you] buy [an] [accident] and death [or] dismemberment policy , [you] know , [it] pre specified _in_ [the] policy so much [but] I don't know [that] [you] can necessarily _put_ [a] [, a] value [on] somebody's [limb] [, uh ,] arbitrarily [that] is always _going to_ fit _in_ all cases . 
A|14| A: Uh-huh . 
B|15| B: I [think] maybe [you] look at [, uh ,] [the] age [of the] [person] and _their_ station _in_ life and , and [, uh [,] how] much longer _they have_ [of] _work_ years [that] [they] would _have _to_ put_ [up] , [you] know , with , with [that] . I mean maybe [you] don't award [an] eighty-five year old guy [the] same thing [that] [you] would award [a] twenty-one year old . 
A|16| A: Huh . 
B|17| B: I , I [think] [it] has [to] be [some] [kind of] common [sense] applied there . And there may be [where] [the] judiciary is [a] little [more] learned [about] [that] [type] [of] thing because [they] can be schooled _in_ [that] [kind of] thing , 
A|18| A: Uh-huh . 
B|19| B: and [that] can be part [of] continuing education , maybe [for] judges 
A|20| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|21| B: I don't know . 
A|22| A: Right . 
B|23| B: You know , [to] _get_ [into the] economics [of] things [, uh ,] because _if they_ wheel somebody [into] [a] courtroom and [the] jury's heart goes _out_ [to] [that] [person] and [they] [do] one [of] these mega awards , [it] really , [you] know , ultimately is not penalizing [the] [person] [that] they're trying [for] _get_ away . 
A|24| A: _Yeah _._ That's_ true . 
B|25| B: If it's [a] company , [you] know [that] they're _insured_ . Unless [the] award is so staggering [that] [it] goes all beyond _their_ layers [of] _insurance_ which is another pet peeve [of] mine when [they] [do] award punitive damages , 
A|26| A: Huh . 
B|27| B: I [think] those [should] be uninsurable . I [think] those [should _have] to_ be paid [by] [the] corporation itself [that] [, that] did [the] damage . 
A|28| A: [Oh ,] _out of_ As opposed _to the_ [insurance] paying [the] bills , 
B|29| B: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
A|30| A: Uh-huh . _Well ,_ we're , [Who] , who 
B|31| B: _For [,_ for] honest mistakes [where] they've done something and , and something happens . One _of their_ employees causes damage [or] something . _Sure [._ That's] [what] [they] buy [insurance] [for] . 
A|32| A: [do] [they get] , [they get] [insured] , [they get] [insured] from other [insurance] companies [or] [how] does [that] [work] ? 
B|33| B: [Well ,] I was just _talking about_ any company . Uh , let's just say [a] lumber manufacturing company 
A|34| A: [Oh ,] okay , _your_ [talking about] 
B|35| B: and [, uh ,] somebody is [on] [the] premises 
A|36| A: [Sure .] 
B|37| B: and one [of the] employees actually is driving [by] with [a] forklift and he pushes [the] wrong button and he drops [a] load [of] lumber [on] somebody and [it] injures , them . 
A|38| A: Okay . [Well ,] 
B|39| B: [Sure .] Insurance [should] pay [for] [that] . 
A|40| A: _But_ [in] [some] instances you're [going [to] put] companies _out of_ business [by] taking [that] stance _, [if they_ [have] to] take [it] _out of their own_ retained earnings . 
B|41| B: [Well] I'm not [talking about] any loss . I was [talking about] only losses [that] [are] judged [for] [a] punitive damage which is another category [of] , [the] juries [are] awarding damages these days based [on] [the] person's actual injuries and [what] [they] [are] due . And then [they] [are] awarding [a] second amount as punishment [to the] company which is [a] usually [a] lot less . [But] it's [an] , [an] amount they're , designed [to] sting them [a] little [for] [their] , negligence . _For_ gross wanton negligence [in] [a] claim . 
A|42| A: That , [For ,] oh , Uh-huh . 
B|43| B: And unfortunately [the] [the ,] lately [the] courts [have] been deciding [that] those could be paid [for] [by] [insurance] too . 
A|44| A: Uh-huh . 
B|45| B: [So] again , [it] never really penalizes , [the] company doing [the] wrong . 
A|46| A: Right . That [will] , 
B|47| B: They can go right [on] doing [the] same old thing [they] always used [to] . 
A|48| A: Huh . 
B|49| B: And [if] [, if they] know [some] practice is wrong , [you] know , I'm not [talking about] [your] isolated occurrences , I'm [talking] [more] [about] [the ,] [you] know , [the] thing [that] [they] know , maybe they're willfully manufacturing something [that] [they] know is hurting people [out] there and [they] continue [to] [do] [it] even after [they] become aware [of] [that] . 
A|50| A: [Sure .] Okay . 
B|51| B: Then I [think] [they] ought [to] [have to] pay something [out of their own] pocket .
