B|5| B: _Uh-huh ._ [Well I] [am] [a] working mother [I] [have] _three_ [children] [and] [my children] , since [I [,] uh ,] since [they] were [very] young , I've [had] various , um , different alternatives [, [child] care] arrangements [and] _like_ most working mothers [I'm] [really] _not_ defensive [about] [it .] [I] personally feel [, uh [,] in] our particular situation , [I'm] [a] [much] better mother [when] [I] [work] out [of the] home [and] [my] _kids_ [, I] [think] [, are] [very] , [very] secure [, well] raised [children] . My comment [on] [this] [is that] [we] paid [an] absolute fortune over [the] years [for] [a] variety [of] opportunities . 
A|6| A: Huh . 
B|7| B: So [I [,] [I] [,] [I] [,] you know ,] [it] [is] [a] problem . [And [,] but] as [you] pointed out [, [I] [,] I] [think] [the] real problem [is] [the] low [pay] [child] facilities [and] [that] [is] sometimes _what_ some women who [have] [to] [work] _, that_ [is] _all_ [they] can afford [. When] our [children] were [very] young , [we] [had] [a] _pay ,_ [a] live [in] paid baby-sitter [that] [was] wonderful . 
A|8| A: Huh . 
B|9| B: [And] then as [they] [got] older _, they_ went [to , uh [,] I] preferred [to] call them schools [and they] were [really] _all_ day preschools [and they] were wonderful . [And I] [think] [they] [got] exposed [to] [a] [lot of] neat _things_ . 
A|10| A: _Oh_ [, well] that's interesting . 
B|11| B: [But] [we] did , [we really] truly did [pay] [a] fortune . _I mean we_ were paying _at_ [one] point [, well] [about] , [about] _a ,_ close , [about] _five_ _hundred dollars a week_ [for] [two] [children] . 
A|12| A: _Oh_ _, my_ God . 
B|13| B: So . 
A|14| A: [Well] [you] must _have [a_ ,] _just_ [one] hero ace professional job [to] support something _like that ._ 
B|15| B: _Well [,_ I] [I'm] [a] physician . Uh [and ,] as [is] [my] husband . 
A|16| A: _Oh_ [, well] , yeah 
B|17| B: [And [,] and I] felt [, uh ,] [very] _good_ [about] working _. I'm_ [a] pediatrician actually . 
A|18| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|19| B: So [, uh , but] [I] [think] there [are] some wonderful [child care] opportunities out there [for] [children] [but [,] and] [we] _all_ [know] _the kind of things_ [that] _you're supposed to look for ._ [I] [think] , 
A|20| A: [Well ,] [not] , [not] [all] [of] us . You [know] [what] [the kind of things] [you're supposed to look for [.] I'm] [an] engineer . 
B|21| B: [Oh] . [Well] 
A|22| A: [And ,] 
B|23| B: [I] [think] it's real important [that] [you] [have a] [place] [that ,] first [of] [all] parents [have a] [lot of] input into [and] [that] they're always welcome [and] [that] [they] [have a] [lot of] activities where parents come [in] during [the] day [and] [that] _at_ any time [you] can drop [in] . [And] [we] [had] [a] [really] wonderful arrangement [, uh ,] [I'm] with [the] university actually 
A|24| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [and they] [had] [a] wonderful [, uh ,] program [that] started _at_ age _three_ [and] [it] [was] [about] [a] block away from [the] hospital where [I] [work] . [And] [so] , [many] times , _at_ lunchtime [, I] [would] _go_ over [and] visit [the] [children] [and] eat with them [and] see [what] [they] were doing . [And] [they] [had] wonderful _, they_ [had] [things] [like] gardens [and] lots [of] pets [and] [just] _, they_ [had] [a] four [to] [one] [uh ,] teacher student ratio . 
A|26| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|27| B: So [that _,] that_ sort [of] [an] , most [of the] teachers [had] degrees . Uh , 
A|28| A: Five [hundred dollars a week] . For [two] [kids] . 
B|29| B: [Yeah .] 
A|30| A: That's _incredible_ . 
B|31| B: It [was] [incredible] actually 
A|32| A: [Oh] , oh . 
B|33| B: [But] [it] [was] _good_ . _I mean_ [it] [was] , [it] , _at_ [that] time there were [two] [children] [and they] were [in] special programs [and] each [one] [was] [a] [little] over [two] _hundred a week_ [and] then [, in] addition [, I] paid [a] [little] [bit] extra [. But] [the] [kids] were , 
A|34| A: [Well] . 
B|35| B: _I mean_ [they] [really] [had] some great opportunities [. But _,] what_ [you] were alluding [to] earlier [is] [, you know ,] women who [work] [for] minimal _wage_ [and [,] and] [really] [have] feel [they] [have] [to] put their [children] , 
A|36| A: [Yeah .] 
B|37| B: sometimes [they] do put them [in [,] uh ,] fairly low paying situations . 
A|38| A: You [know [,] they] could , somebody will [have a] job [at] [three] [hundred a week] [to] get off welfare [and] [you know ,] that's [a] [good] starting [wage] 
B|39| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [but] boy [three] [hundred dollars a week] doesn't [go] [very] far [on] [child care] . 
B|41| B: [Uh-huh .] No , even [that _,] that_ [really] [, I] [think] [, [I] don't] , it's [been] awhile since I've looked _at [,_ my] youngest [child] [is] eight . So it's [been] [a] [little] while since I've looked into , actually daycare centers [. But] [they] [are] 
A|42| A: Huh . 
B|43| B: [you know [,] the] [good] ones do cost maybe sixty [dollars a week] since . 
A|44| A: [I mean we] used [to] [pay ,] [pay] fifty cents [an] hour [to] baby-sit [. But] mine [are] twenty-two , twenty-three [and] twenty-seven [so] [you know [,] [that] ,] 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [I] guess baby-sitters now [are] up [at [,] what] , [five] [dollars] [an] hour ? 
B|47| B: Something [like that .] 
A|48| A: [Oh] [my] . 
B|49| B: [Well [,] you know [,] but] [you] made [the] comment earlier [, why would] someone [be interested in] [children] . [I mean] [it] has [been] [a] real [, uh ,] there [have] [been] some [good] entrepreneurial type experiences . [And I] [think] [, I] [think] [they] [have] captured [a] certain market . Again [the [,] but] then there [are] baby-sitting groups . As [a] pediatrician [, one of the] [things] we've [been] real [concerned about is] [the] infections . 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: As [you] start putting lots [of] [little] [kids] together [, the] infection rates [that] [go] around 
A|52| A: [Oh] , yeah .
