A|0| A: _So where_ _was_ your _last vacation_ ? 
B|1| B: _Uh _,_ actually_ _my_ _last vacation _was_ in_ Connecticut _. Uh _,_ we_ _went_ home _to_ _visit_ family . Before _that_ _we were_ _in_ _Hawaii_ . 
A|2| A: _Oh_ _, I_ , I'd _, well_ [actually] _I_ _did_ [visit] [Hawaii] once _but I_ never made _it_ _off_ _of_ _Oahu ,_ which _I've_ heard is not _the_ nicest _of the_ _islands_ . 
B|3| B: [Oh] _. It_ _wasn't_ [actually] _. It_ , when _we were_ _in_ [Oahu _,] uh [,_ I] couldn't wait _to get_ [off] _We_ _, we_ _took a_ cruise _and we_ _went to_ four different [islands] _and _it_ _was_ a_ _really_ nice , Kauai [was] nice _and_ Maui [was] nice _. _We_ had_ _, _we_ had_ _a_ great _time ._ 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: _We_ _were there_ _for ten days_ . 
A|6| A: [Oh] _that's ,_ _wow _._ Yeah ._ 
B|7| B: [Yeah] , yes . [So where] _have_ _you_ _been_ ? 
A|8| A: [Oh] _I've_ _I've_ [been] lots _of_ _places_ . My [last vacation was] [actually] [in] _Morocco _I_ guess_ _we _,_ that_ one _would_ count , 
B|9| B: [Morocco] . Really . 
A|10| A: [Uh _,] that_ [was] about [a] year [and] [a] half ago _, _and_ ,_ 
B|11| B: _No_ kidding . _what_ _, what_ , _did you_ _just_ decide _to go there_ _or_ , 
A|12| A: [Uh _,] well_ [my] husband is French [and [we] were] living _in France_ at _the_ [time] 
B|13| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [and we] decided _that I_ , _I've_ never [been] [to] Africa _and I_ needed [to get] [that] continent since [I] hadn't [been] [there] yet . And _it , it's_ [, actually] _it's a_ fairly common [vacation] place [for] French _people_ [to go] _and they_ speak French _and ,_ _so [,_ uh _,] _you know ,_ in_ [that] sense is [just] _a little_ _bit_ easier 
B|15| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|16| A: [and it] [just] seemed _like_ [it] _would be_ [a] fun place [to go] . And , [So] _we [,_ we] didn't [really] [have] enough [time .] 
B|17| B: [Yeah .] [Oh] _I'm_ sure _it was_ _wonderful_ . 
A|18| A: [We had] about , _a little_ _bit_ less than two weeks . 
B|19| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: And as always _, it_ [it] seems _a bit [,_ uh ,] rushed [. We] do [a] lot _of_ traveling _around_ [. We] rented [a] car [and] drove pretty much everywhere . 
B|21| B: Was [it] hot ? 
A|22| A: [No] _, in_ fact some _of the_ [days] [we] froze _. It was_ , 
B|23| B: Really ? 
A|24| A: _well_ [we [were] there] _in the_ winter . In [uh ,] January [or] February [, _I] don't remember_ which , 
B|25| B: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh _._ _I_ was_ born [in] Saudi Arabia [and [,] uh ,] when [my] father worked [there] [we _,] they_ used _to travel_ quite [a bit ,] _all_ [around] [you know , _in] [,_ in] _Europe_ [and] whatnot , 
A|26| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
B|27| B: [but _I] was_ _very_ young _so [I_ don't remember] [that] [and [,] _I] was_ three when [we] moved back here . 
A|28| A: At at , excuse _me_ , at [what] age [did _you] ,_ [Oh] _, that's_ _too_ bad _because_ , 
B|29| B: [So] [I don't remember] _but we_ [have] _all_ these _wonderful_ pictures [of] _all_ these great [places] [that] [they] _have been_ 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|31| B: [and] [that _I] was_ when _I _was_ a_ baby [but] [so ,] [Morocco _I] think_ [would be] _wonderful_ [because] [that's [,] you know _,] that's [,_ that] area [of the] world _I think_ [would be] great . 
A|32| A: [Yeah _.] It [was_ a] [very] interesting [vacation] . The only thing [I] didn't _like_ [was in] some [of the] more touristy areas [uh ,] um , [the] _, it_ [would] [just] [be] besieged _by_ _people_ wanting [to] [be] your guide 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: _and _you_ ,_ [there] [were] some [places] , [where] _people_ , 
B|35| B: [Yeah .] 
A|36| A: [there] [would be] kids [there] [that] [were] excellent at ripping [you] [off] , 
B|37| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [and [we] had] nothing taken [because] [we] knew [and [we] had] _things_ [in] inside pockets [and] _in , [you know ,_ in] jacket underneath [a] coat type [of] thing . 
B|39| B: Really . 
A|40| A: But , 
B|41| B: [We] [, we] found [that] [in] Jamaica [. It was] [the] same _way_ [, that] [people] [would] come _up_ [and] try [and] sell [you [,] well] try [and] sell drugs [and] [things] _like that_ 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [but] [they] _, they were_ [so] destitute [and [I] guess] [they] _, they_ make _all_ their money on tourism [and [,] [and] they] [would] come _up_ [and] ask [you [,] you know ,] _if_ , _if you_ want [to] buy different [things] [and] _really _,_ after_ awhile [it] [really] gets annoying , 
A|44| A: [Yeah .] 
B|45| B: [you know _,] [it _,_ it's] [a_ little] scary [too] when they're coming _up_ [and] they're _all_ _over_ _you ._ 
A|46| A: The , [the] worst place [was in] Marrakech 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [and] [the] other cities [it] [wasn't] nearly as bad [and] [a] couple [of] them [it was] [, what] [we] [did] [in] some [of the] other cities [and they] tell [you] [to] do [that] is [to] hire [a] local guide 
B|49| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [it] doesn't matter who [it] is [and they] keep everyone _else_ away from [you .] 
B|51| B: [Oh] [really] . 
A|52| A: And [it's] worth [it] [and] [it's] [like] [ten] _dollars_ [a] day [or] something [and] its worth [it] [just] [to] keep everyone _else_ away from badgering [you] 
B|53| B: Really . 
A|54| A: _and you_ feel stupid doing [that] [but we] [did] [it ,] 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and [we] were] much happier , 
B|57| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: _and you_ also [get] [in] [to] _see_ [things] [that] [you] might not [get] into [if you] [were] alone [, uh ,] 
B|59| B: [Uh-huh .] Well [that's] great . Where [else] [have] [you] [been] ? 
A|60| A: [Uh] 
B|61| B: Well [you] lived [in France] , 
A|62| A: Yes . 
B|63| B: [so] you've _been all through Europe_ . 
A|64| A: [No] [actually] [I] haven't [been all through Europe] , [like] [I] haven't [been] [to] Italy yet . 
B|65| B: [No] . Really . 
A|66| A: [Uh ,] we're going [to go] _for a_ conference [in] September [and] [so ,] hopefully , we'll [get] [to travel] [a little] [bit] [too] . 
B|67| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [Uh ,] [my] more exciting spots [have been] , _I've_ [been] [to] [the] Galapagos Islands . 
B|69| B: Really ? 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh] [, that] [was] one [of the] most [wonderful] vacations _I've_ ever [had] . 
B|71| B: Lots [of] _wildlife_ huh ? [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: Yes . If [you] [like] [wildlife] [, it's a] fabulous [vacation] . 
B|73| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: If _you don't_ [like] [wildlife] [it's] probably not [of] interest But [it [,] that] [was] [really ,] [really] fabulous [and] [just] [the] photos [I] [have] [of] [it] [and] gosh , incredible [and] [be] [so] close , 
B|75| B: Now when [was] _that ,_ when [were] [you] [there] ? 
A|76| A: Um , August , eighty-eight . 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: And then [, actually] [, after] [there] [I] [went to] um , [Hawaii] , [a] lot [of] [my] [travel] has [been] sort [of] based [around] conferences [or] business meetings 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: [and] [so [,] I] [went to] [Hawaii] [and] then [to] Australia [and] _Japan_ [and] China , 
B|81| B: [Uh-huh .] Did [you] [go] on [the] _Barrier_ [did you] [see] _the Great Barrier Reef_ [and [,] and] [go] snorkeling ? 
A|82| A: [I] [, I] [, actually] [I] didn't [go] _diving ._ 
B|83| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [I] , [I'm] [a] diver [and] [so [,] that's [,] that's] [actually] [been] another [of] [my] favorite vacations has [been] taking [little] _diving_ trips 
B|85| B: [Oh] [diving [.] Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [but] [, uh ,] no [I] didn't [get] [to] [the Great Barrier Reef] [. I] drove from Sidney down [to] Melbourne [and] [over] [to] Adelaide . 
B|87| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: It's gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . The coastline [was] [just] incredible . It's huge . 
B|89| B: Is [it] [really] ? 
A|90| A: Australia _. Yeah ._ 
B|91| B: [Yeah] _, yeah_ . 
A|92| A: [Uh ,] [but] , 
B|93| B: Did _you have_ _shrimp_ ? [I've] seen [in _, you know ,] they_ _, they_ show [all] _this_ [wonderful] seafood [and [,] and] great big prawns [, you know] [the] big _shrimp_ [and ,] 
A|94| A: [I don't remember] [if] [I] [had] [shrimp] . 
B|95| B: [No] ? Didn't [have] [shrimp] [there] huh 
A|96| A: [I don't] [think] [so] . 
B|97| B: [I] [remember] food 
A|98| A: [Oh] [, I] [like that] [too] . But [, uh [,] in] fact [I] didn't eat out [that] much [there] [because] [I was] traveling _by_ myself [in] [a] car [, it] [would] [have been] [, [I] think] , much more fun [to] do [it] [like] _in the_ van , with [a] bunch [of] [people] . 
B|99| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: But [, uh ,] 
B|101| B: [Oh] _you're_ adventurous . You [went] [by] yourself . 
A|102| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: Really . 
A|104| A: And [I was] [by] myself [in] China [too] . 
B|105| B: Really ? 
A|106| A: [Yeah .] 
B|107| B: [Oh] [wow .] 
A|108| A: China [was [a] little] [bit] more [, uh ,] [of] [a] challenge . But [, it [,] it] [wasn't] more [of] [a] challenge [in] [a] sense [because] [I] hired [a] guide [all] [the] [time] , 
B|109| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [and] [so I] never [, you know ,] got out [by] myself , [or] not much , 
B|111| B: [Uh-huh .] Was [it] [very] expensive ? 
A|112| A: [No] [, actually] [I] paid about either _a thousand dollars_ [or] [a little] [bit ,] no maybe [it was] about _a thousand dollars_ , maybe [a little] [bit] less [, [I] _don't] really_ [remember] , [for ten days] including [all] [my] meals , [a] guide , [a] car , [the] airfare [and ,] [but] [this] is from Hong Kong , 
B|113| B: You're kidding ! [No] kidding ! [Uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [because] [I was] already [in] Hong Kong [and ,] um , [but] [it] only cost [you] about _a thousand dollars_ [to go there] [and I] [went to] Beijing , Shanghai , Chengdu [and] [actually] then [I] [took a] train [up] from Shanghai [to] [a little] , Quingdao [I think] is [the] name [of] [it] . It's [a little] [, uh ,] sort [of] getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai . It's [just] [a] train ride . 
B|115| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: And [that [,] I] [had] two internal , one _, yeah ,_ two internal plane flights [and] [a] couple [of] other [things] [. It was] [really ,] 
B|117| B: All [for [a] thousand dollars] ? 
A|118| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: Wow ! That [really] surprises [me] . 
A|120| A: Around [a thousand] . 
B|121| B: [I guess] [I] relate [it] [to] , [to] [Japan] [where] [things] are [very] expensive , aren't [they] ? 
A|122| A: [Oh] , Japan's ridiculous . 
B|123| B: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
A|124| A: And [I] stayed [, I] didn't _stay in the_ top [of the] line hotels [but I] stayed [in [,] they were] [all] completely clean , 
B|125| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|126| A: [and [,] you know [, they] were] newly built [and [they] were] sort [of the] lower end [of the] top [of the] line , hotels _, because_ [they] said [you] can't _stay in the_ cheap stuff . 
B|127| B: [Uh-huh [.] Yeah] [, yeah [,] [and] [you] don't] want [to] [stay in the] [very] , [very] , [very] exclusive [, _because] [you_ [don't] really] even [get] [a] flavor [of the] country [if] _you're_ , 
A|128| A: Right . Right . 
B|129| B: [Yeah] [, yeah] . Wow . 
A|130| A: [Uh ,] [but] [yeah [,] that] [was] [, I] highly recommend [that] [way] [to go] . If [you're] ever interested [in] going [the] route [, I] dealt with [this] woman , her name [was] Rita at China Tours [in] Boston 
B|131| B: [Oh] [really] . 
A|132| A: [Yeah [.] Uh [,] and] [a] friend [of] mine who [had] gone [for a] business trip [to] China [and] she [just] gave [me] [this] woman's name [to] contact [and it] [would] [really] [be] fun [, [I] think] ideally with [like] two couples [because [you] have] [a] car [and] [a] driver [and] [a] guide 
B|133| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|134| A: [and] then ,
