B|25| B: If [we] can cut [back] [the] usage , [then] [uh ,] maybe [it] _will_ [have to] _go_ someplace [else] . 
A|26| A: [And] [I think] [it's] [really] [very] sad [that] north [of the] border [, you know ,] [the] United States [and] Canada [is so] different , from [the] from South America [, and] Central America . 
B|27| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh] , yeah .
