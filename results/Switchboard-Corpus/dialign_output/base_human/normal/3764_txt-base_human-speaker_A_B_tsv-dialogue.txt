A|0| A: _I_ guess _you_ heard our our _topic_ _for_ today was clothing ? 
B|1| B: _Yes _,_ I_ _certainly_ did . 
A|2| A: How _you_ _dress for_ _work and_ season _to_ season _and_ everything . 
B|3| B: Uh-huh . 
A|4| A: How _do you_ _dress for_ _work_ ? 
B|5| B: Well _, uh _,_ uh_ _about_ _the_ same _I [dress_ for] school _. I_ _, uh _, I_ am a_ graduate student _so _,_ I_ don't _have to_ worry too much _about_ _, uh ,_ _what_ _I wear_ too much _of _the_ time ._ Which _is_ nice . 
A|6| A: _Sure ._ 
B|7| B: _Uh_ _Uh _,_ uh ,_ although [I] [do] _, uh , _a_ lot _of_ ,_ 
A|8| A: _You_ bet . 
B|9| B: _I am a_ speech pathology major [and] _so I_ [do] _a lot of_ clinical [work and] _when I_ [do] clinic [work] _then I_ _have to_ _, uh _,_ uh ,_ _look my best_ . 
A|10| A: Look _professional_ 
B|11| B: _Yeah_ . Unfortunately . 
A|12| A: _Yeah [,_ I] understand [. [I] am a] [, I] own [my] company [. [I] am] _in the_ _, I am , uh ,_ manufactures rep sales organization [and] [my] office [is] [a] small office [and] [I am] very casual [and] [wear] slacks [and] sports _shirt_ [and] things _like_ _that_ 
B|13| B: Uh-huh . 
A|14| A: _but_ [then] [when I] travel _it_ [is] _a little_ different situation . 
B|15| B: [Yeah ,] sure . Uh-huh . [Yeah] . [Yeah] . _Uh [,_ uh ,] [do you] find _that [,_ uh ,] _on the_ average [do] _people_ give [uh ,] _more credibility_ _or_ less _credibility to_ _a professional_ [, uh ,] [to] professionally dressed _individual ._ 
A|16| A: [Yeah [,] I] think _in_ today's society [, uh ,] there [is] [more [credibility] to] be quite honest 
B|17| B: Uh-huh . 
A|18| A: [I] will always remember [, I] will tell this real quick story [when I] graduated from college , [my] first job years ago [, uh ,] thirty years ago , twenty-nine years ago _, in_ fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer . 
B|19| B: Uh-huh . 
A|20| A: [I] worked [for] [the] [, uh ,] Smith Douglas Division [of] Borden Chemical [and] [I] sold [uh ,] [you] _know ,_ manure . 
B|21| B: Uh-huh . 
A|22| A: And [, uh , I] _would_ _go_ out [and] call [on] _farmers_ [and] [I] _would_ always try _to [look_ my best] wearing sport coats [and] things _like_ [that _,] but_ [I] was calling [on] guys [that] wore bib overalls . 
B|23| B: Uh-huh . 
A|24| A: And [so ,] one day [I] got up [and] thought _well_ [I] will _just_ _go_ casual [and] [you] _know_ [that] [I] called [on] [a] guy wearing exactly [that ,] bib overalls _, and_ he sort [of] told _me_ [that] he expected _me_ [to] be [professional] 
B|25| B: Uh-huh . 
A|26| A: [and] he sort [of] expected _me_ [to] [dress] as [a professional] 
B|27| B: Oh , really ? 
A|28| A: [so [,] uh _,] it_ was sort [of ,] 
B|29| B: Even [the] [farmers] . 
A|30| A: _You_ bet even back [then] 
B|31| B: Oh , wow . 
A|32| A: [so I] sort [, uh ,] _been_ aware [of] [my] [dress] ever since [then] [and] try _to [look_ my best] , 
B|33| B: Uh-huh . 
A|34| A: _but_ here again [I dress] casual quite [a] _bit_ [so ,] 
B|35| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] _certainly_ . 
A|36| A: It gives [you] confidence . In [my] business _if I_ call [on the] [the] J C Penney company here _in_ Dallas [or] say someone say Sears [and] Roebuck _in_ Chicago , [then [I] wear] coat [and] _tie_ . If [I] call [on] _just_ [, uh , a] normal _little_ dealer [of] mine [, I] might be casual . 
B|37| B: Uh-huh . 
A|38| A: [I] call [on] Oshman's sporting goods , again _, it_ may be casual [or] _it_ may be coat [and] _tie_ . So _it depends ._ 
B|39| B: [Yeah [,] [it] depends .] [Sure .] _Uh ,_ [so] [you] don't [, uh ,] [if] [you] had [the] choice [would] [you] [wear] [a] [tie] [or] _not_ ? 
A|40| A: [Uh ,] probably _no_ . 
B|41| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
A|42| A: _but_ [then] [it depends] [on] who [you] _are_ calling [on] . Who _you're ,_ [you] _like_ _your_ minister standing up _in_ front [of] [you] _with_ _no_ [tie] , [you] _just_ [, uh ,] he [would] be missing something . 
B|43| B: Uh-huh . 
A|44| A: Although , he shouldn't be evaluated [on] [that] . 
B|45| B: _Right_ , right . 
A|46| A: So , it's its' _just_ different . 
B|47| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] [that [,] uh ,] [if] [if] [you] wanted [to] [, uh [,] uh ,] really get into [a] hot issue [, uh] [well] at least [in] some [in] some beliefs [, uh ,] how _people_ [dress] [when] they _go to_ church [is] [, uh ,] [is] [uh ,] sometimes [a] pretty , pretty hot [topic] . 
A|48| A: [Yes [,] it] [is] [. _I] am , uh ,_ _like_ [a] Catholic [and] [the] [people] [that] [go to] [my] _Church_ , [you] _know_ Catholics [dress] very casual [a lot [of] the] _times_ . People [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever _, but_ yet [the] way [I] was _raised_ [, I am a] converted Catholic , [the] way [I] was _raised_ [, I] was _raised_ [a] Baptist [and] _like_ as [a] youngster [I] use [to] always [dress] up all [the time [.] I] guess [that] has changed also . 
B|49| B: Uh-huh [Uh ,] yeah . I'm [, I am [, uh ,] I] [go to] [the] [Church] [of] Christ [. I] _have_ [been] [raised] [in the] [Church] [of] Christ _and , uh [,_ but] [, uh , I] [, uh ,] too many [times] [you] hear [you] hear [a lot] _about_ _what_ _what_ [you're [,] uh ,] supposed [you're] supposed [to look] [your] Sunday [best] [uh [,] uh [,] and] [dress] [and] proper attire 
A|50| A: [Right] . 
B|51| B: _and , uh [,_ and] sometimes [that] really disappoints [me] [, uh [,] in] [, uh ,] [when I] see [in] other economic areas [like] [in] Kentucky . 
A|52| A: [Sure .] 
B|53| B: [You] [know ,] [people] [just] don't _have_ [that] [and] they [are] afraid [to] [go to] church [or] afraid [to] [go] simply because they don't _have_ [the] clothes [to] [wear] . 
A|54| A: _But_ . That [is] [a] very good point [. [I] am] from West Virginia [so I] understand [what] [you] [are] saying there 
B|55| B: Uh-huh . 
A|56| A: [and] it's it's [a] very good point . 
B|57| B: [Yeah] . 
A|58| A: _But_ [you] shouldn't , what's [the] old saying , [you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|59| B: Certainly . 
A|60| A: And [, uh ,] evaluation [of] an [individual .] Course , all [of] [it depends] [on the] type [of] job responsibility [you] [have] [. I] think [you] [have to] [dress] sort [of] accordingly . 
B|61| B: Uh-huh . 
A|62| A: _But , uh ,_ [you] [certainly] should [not] judge [a] book by its cover [and , uh ,] [or] evaluate [a] person by [that] . 
B|63| B: Uh-huh . 
A|64| A: What [about] season [to] season . Does [, I] guess [your] [dress] changes . 
B|65| B: [Uh ,] yeah [a little] [bit] . [Uh [,] uh] [of] course [in the] summer [if I] can get away [with] [it] [, [I] wear] [, uh [,] uh , a] pair [of] shorts [and] that's [it] . Run around barefoot , [no] [shirt] [or] anything [But , uh ,]
