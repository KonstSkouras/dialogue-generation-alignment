A|0| A: _So_ _you _have_ a_ _child_ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|1| B: _Yeah_ _we_ , Two _year_ old daughter _in child care_ _and_ _we_ went through _the_ process _of_ searching _for child care_ _and_ _uh ,_ finding _what_ _we_ consider _to be_ , real _good_ _child care at_ _a _,_ uh ,_ _pretty_ reasonable price , _we_ think . 
A|2| A: _Uh ,_ 
B|3| B: How _about_ [you] , _do_ [you have] any children ? 
A|4| A: Yes , _our_ first [and] he _just_ turned _three_ months . 
B|5| B: Oh , boy . 
A|6| A: _So_ , _we're_ _just_ starting _into_ hunting [for _child care] ._ 
B|7| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|8| A: Right now , _both_ [of] us _are_ students . 
B|9| B: Are [you] ? Where [are] [a] student ? 
A|10| A: _Uh ,_ _Uh ,_ University [of] Southern Mississippi . 
B|11| B: No kidding . 
A|12| A: _Uh ,_ she's , 
B|13| B: _I_ was [a] professor _in_ [a] _university_ here _in_ California [for] [a] while . 
A|14| A: [Yeah .] 
B|15| B: _Yeah _,_ uh ,_ [are] [you] _going _to_ , uh ,_ put your son _in child care_ _in_ _a , _a_ year_ or two ? 
A|16| A: _Uh ,_ _probably_ _. Uh ,_ actually spring semester [a year] _from_ now he's [going to] _have [to_ be] [in child care] [uh ,] five days [a] week _more_ _than_ likely _. Uh ,_ depending _on_ how _my_ class schedule runs 
B|17| B: [Yeah .] 
A|18| A: _because_ _my_ wife _will_ [be] doing _her_ internship _that_ semester . 
B|19| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: It _will_ [be] _forty_ hour week , not , no , eight [to] five type [of] _thing_ . 
B|21| B: [Yeah .] 
A|22| A: _So_ depending _on_ [what] _my_ class schedule looks _like_ , he may spend four , anywhere _from_ four [to] eight hours [a] day [in [child care] at] _that_ point . Right now _we're_ trying [to] avoid _it ,_ _but_ [we] _just ,_ as _a matter of fact_ _just_ yesterday hired [a , a] girl [to , uh ,] watch him _. Uh _,_ I_ _get_ _out_ [of] class [at] certain time [and] _my_ wife _is_ already supposed [to be] _on_ _her_ _way to_ _her_ class . You _know ,_ once [a] day _this_ overlap happens where [we] can't , one [of] us [be] _home ._ 
B|23| B: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
A|24| A: _So_ [for] [about] twenty twenty , _thirty_ minutes [a] day [we] _got_ [a] baby-sitter _comes in_ . 
B|25| B: Well , that's [a] _good_ experience [, I] think , [and] [, uh ,] there [are] _a lot of_ _things_ [to] think [about] [and] _the_ articles [that] [are] written _on the_ topic , [are] _pretty good_ [and] _they_ kind [of] boil down [to , uh ,] any other important decision [you] _really_ [have to] explore _the_ alternative 
A|26| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|27| B: [and] [what] [we] found [, uh ,] [to be] _the best_ guide was [our] own instincts [about] , _people_ who _were_ [going [to] be] loving 
A|28| A: [Yeah .] 
B|29| B: [and] [, uh ,] that's [more] important [than] anything else . We could [have] sent [, uh ,] [her] [to] [a] fancier [, uh ,] facility . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [Uh ,] she goes [to] [a] [home .] This [is] [a [,] uh [,] a] couple [, uh ,] emigrated [from] China early [in] , [in] _their_ lives . 
A|32| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: They've been here [probably] [thirty] , [forty] years . 
A|34| A: [Yeah .] 
B|35| B: They've [got] [three] daughters [. Uh ,] [and] _, they have a_ loving [home] [and] [, uh ,] they're [both] there [and] _they have a_ kid [that] [comes in] [and] helps them [in] _the_ afternoon . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: _And_ [our] daughter [is] healthy , happy , well adjusted [and] enjoys [going to] see [her] friends , 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] 
B|39| B: so _it's_ [a] _good_ experience . 
A|40| A: [Uh _,] that_ makes [a] big difference . 
B|41| B: [I] _if_ _it's_ _good_ [, I] think _it's_ very _good_ [for] _the child_ . 
A|42| A: Yes . 
B|43| B: _And_ _if_ _it's_ [, a] loving environment [, I] think _it's_ very _good_ [and] , [and] that's _really_ [what] we've learned [about] [it] . She'll [have to] go [on] [to] something [more] stimulating [in] terms [of] preschool [in] [a year] 
A|44| A: [Yeah .] 
B|45| B: [but] [, uh ,] [we] feel real fortunate [and] _we were_ able [to , uh ,] [just [,] uh ,] choose [in] _the_ marketplace . [I] don't [know] [what] _it's_ [like] around [, uh ,] Hattiesburg . 
A|46| A: There's [a lot of] [child care] available , [but] invariably there's _waiting_ lists . 
B|47| B: _Uh-huh . Yeah ._ 
A|48| A: [And] [we were] [a] little slow getting [on the] _waiting list_ with [the] [, uh ,] okay _, the_ [university] [, uh ,] university's [, uh] [uh ,] department [of] _, uh , uh ,_ [their] Home Ec Department 
B|49| B: [Yeah .] I'll bet they're involved _. Yeah ._ 
A|50| A: [uh [,] they] [, uh [,] they have a] subbranch [, uh ,] American Family Counseling [and] [their] [people] staff _this_ , _this_ [, uh _,] [the_ [child] care] center [just] off campus . But [, uh [,] they have a] [pretty good] size _waiting list_ . 
B|51| B: [Yeah] 
A|52| A: _So_ , 
B|53| B: Well , that's [, uh [,] I] [know] _it's_ , _it's_ [a] real hard [thing] _to do_ , even [for] [people] [in] , [in] [, uh ,] [university] communities . 
A|54| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: Out here [at] Manford [, they have [a] ,] [you] [know [,] [a] , [a] , a] real [good] facility [and] there [, uh ,] [is] quite [a] [waiting list] [to] [get] [into] [that] . 
A|56| A: [Yeah .] 
B|57| B: [So] _it's_ [, uh , uh ,] [you] [know ,] _it's_ [a ,] _it's_ [a ,] _it's_ an important , decision , _it's_ an industry that's still _a cottage_ industry 
A|58| A: [Yeah . [Yeah] ,] 
B|59| B: [and] [I] think [this] [is] _really_ [is] buyer beware . Well , [it] [is] _the best way to do [it_ ,] interestingly . 
A|60| A: [a cottage] industry's [the best way to do it] [really] , _because_ [if] [you] over , 
B|61| B: [I] think [that] [, uh ,] [my] own interest [in] , [in] development , human development leads me [to] believe [that] that's [a] [good] sign [and] [that] [, uh ,] private enterprise [is] [the] [way to] go [and] [that] [it] [will] lead [to] [a] fundamental change [in] [the] [way] [we] learn . 
A|62| A: [Uh-huh . [Yeah .] Yeah .] 
B|63| B: Because [, I] think [what] [we're] [going to] go [to] [is] _much_ [more] commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures [in] [the] market . As [a matter of fact] , [my] future [is] banked [on] [that] [, uh ,] professionally [because] [I] believe [that] [, that] there [are] [, uh ,] pressing needs [in] [the] marketplace , unmet by schools , colleges universities [for] [, uh ,] learning [a lot of] _things_ [that] kids can learn watching _Sesame Street_ [and] [in [child care] .] 
A|64| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: Primary skills which turn [out] [to be] [the] most important skills [in] life . 
A|66| A: Yes . [And] [it's] amazing how [much] [good] [things] [like] [, uh ,] [Sesame Street] [will] [do] . 
B|67| B: It's , [it's] phenomenal . It's phenomenal [, the] programming [, the] human operating system ,
